This is the OpenACS - the Open Architecture Community System.

Version 4.6b2

OpenACS is an advanced toolkit for building scalable,
community-oriented web applications.

The original ACS - the Arsdigita Community System, which formed the
foundation of OpenACS is described in

The original ACS was Copyright (C) 1995-2000 ArsDigita Corporation
and, in some cases, individual authors.

OpenACS is a community created and supported software system, visit

The major change in OpenACS 4.x is its database-independence; it can
