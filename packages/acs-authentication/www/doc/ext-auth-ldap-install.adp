<strong>ToDo: </strong>Add/verify information on
on-demand sync, account registration, and batch synchronization.
Add section on ldapsearch.</p><p>
<strong>Overview. </strong>You do not want to make
users remember yet another password and username. If you can avoid
it you do not want to store their passwords either. This document
should help you set your system up so your users can seamlessly log
in to your OpenACS instance using the password they are accustomed
to using for other things at your institution.</p><p>
<strong>Background. </strong>The original OpenACS
LDAP implementation (which has been depreciated by this package)
treated the LDAP server as another data store similar to Oracle or
Postgresql. It opened a connection using a privileged account and
read or stored an encrypted password for the user in question. This
password was independent of the user&#39;s operating system or
network account, and had to be synchronized if you wanted the same
password for OpenACS.Save their passwords? Sync passwords? Deal
with forgotten password requests? No Thanks. Using ldap bind, you
can delegate authentication completely to LDAP. This way you can
let the IT department (if you are lucky) worry about password
storage/synchronization/etc. The bind operation takes a username
and password and returns a true of false depending on whether they
match up. This document takes the 'bind' approach so that
your users LDAP/AD password (or whatever else you use) can be used
to login to OpenACS.</p><p>
<strong>Note on Account Creation. </strong>On the
authentication driver configure screens, you will also see lots of
options for synchronizing users between your directory and OpenACS.
This document takes the approach of provisioning users on demand
instead of ahead-of-time. This means that when they attempt to
login to OpenACS, if they have a valid Windows account, we&#39;ll
create an account for them in OpenACS and log them in.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">

that you see something like this in your error.log:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">

<strong>auth-ldap + driver
installation. </strong>Next, visit the software
installation page in acs-admin and install the auth-ldap package.
Your OpenACS installation now has all the code required to
authenticate using nsldap, so now you need to configure your
site&#39;s authentication to take advantage of it. To add the
authentication driver to your OpenACS instance, go to: Main Site,
Site-Wide Administration, and then AuthenticationHere&#39;s some
sample Authentication Driver values:Name=Active Directory, Short
Name=AD, Enabled=Yes, Authentication=LDAP, Password
Management=LDAPYou may wish to push this new authority to the top
of the list so it will become the default for users on the login
screen.Next, you have to configure the authentication driver
parameters by going to: Main Site, Site-Wide Administration,
Authentication, Active Directory, and then ConfigureParameters that
match our example will look like:UsernameAttribute=sAMAccountNMame,
BaseDN= cn=Users,dc=mydomain,dc=com,
InfoAttributeMap=first_names=givenName;last_name=sn;email=mail,
PasswordHash=N/A</p></li><li>
<p>
<strong>Code Tweaks for Bind. </strong>Bind-style
authentication is not supported via configuration parameters, so we
will have to modify the tcl authentication routine to provide this
behavior.You&#39;ll have to modify the existing
./packages/auth-ldap/tcl/auth-ldap-procs.tcl file to support bind
authentication.First toggle ldap bind support.Change this:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">
# LDAP bind based authentication ?
set ldap_bind_p 0
if {$ldap_bind_p==1} {
...
    </code></pre><p>to this:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">
# LDAP bind based authentication ?
set ldap_bind_p 1

if {$ldap_bind_p==1} {
...
    </code></pre><p>Then change the bind to first do a search to resolve to account
name provided by the user to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN),
which the LDAP server uses as a primary key.Change this:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">
set lh [ns_ldap gethandle]

if {[ns_ldap bind $lh "cn=$cn" "$password"]} {
    set result(auth_status) ok
}    
    </code></pre><p>to this</p><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">
set lh [ns_ldap gethandle]

set fdn [lindex [lindex [ns_ldap search $lh -scope subtree $params(BaseDN) "($params(UsernameAttribute)=$username)" dn] 0] 1]

if {[ns_ldap bind $lh $fdn $password]} {
    set result(auth_status) ok
}    
    </code></pre>

<strong>Troubleshooting. </strong>If you&#39;re
having trouble figuring out some the values for the ldapm, see this
useful page on <a href="https://www.rhyous.com/2009/11/10/how-to-configure-bugzilla-to-authenticate-to-active-directory/" target="_top">setting up Active Directory integration with
Bugzilla</a>. It explains how distinguished names are defined in
Active Directory, and how to test that you have the correct values
for connectivity and base DN using the OpenLDAP command-line
utility ldapsearch.John had an issue where nsldap was not loading
because AOLServer couldn&#39;t find the openldap client libraries,
but he was able to fix it by adding the openldap libraries to his
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.g. /usr/local/openldap/lib)</p><p>
