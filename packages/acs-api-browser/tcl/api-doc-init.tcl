# Decide, whether we want to include calling-info based on static
# analysis in the procdoc structure (what function calls what other
# functions). This calling-info is just relevant for developer
# instances. The computation of the calling-info is not blazingly
# fast, so just do it when needed.
#
# To activate the computation of calling-info, add a section like the
# following to your NaviServer config file. Note that the
# calling-info is not necessarily complete (it is not always possible
# to derive call calls from the static analysis), also direct calls
# from web pages are not included.
