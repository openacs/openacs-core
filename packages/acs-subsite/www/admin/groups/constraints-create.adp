Relational segments allows you to treat all parties that have a
@rel_type_pretty_name@ to @group_name@ as a party itself. This is
useful for assigning permissions and for further constraining which
parties can use the @rel_type_pretty_name@. 

<p>

Once you create a relational segment, you will be able to create
relational constraints on that segment. Relational constraints allow
you to apply rules on inter-party relationships

Would you like to create a relational segment and/or constraints now?
