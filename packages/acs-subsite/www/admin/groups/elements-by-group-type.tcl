#
# Datasource for elements-by-rel-type.adp 
# (meant to be included by other templates) 
#
# Shows the user a summary of components (NOT members!) of the given 
# group, provided that the the user has permission to see the component.  
# The components are summarized by their relationship to the given group.
#
# NOTE:
# There is no scope check done here to ensure that the component "belongs" to
# the subsite.  The pages that use this template already check that the
# given group_id is in scope; therefore, all of its components must be in
# scope.  And even if a developer screws up and uses this template without
# checking that the give group_id belongs to the current subsite, the user
# would only be able to see components that they have permission to see.
# Thus we take the lazy (and efficient) approach of not checking the
# scope of the components returned by this datasource.

# ISSUE: this doesn't check permissions when generating the number_groups.
# So a user might be told that there are 156 groups of type X, then when they
# click to zoom in, they see only 10 groups listed (because they only have
# permission on 10 groups).  I think the group-types/groups-display page 
# should tell you total number of groups, and tell you "these are the ones
# you have read privilege on", so you don't get confused.
