    Implementation of the interface acs_mail_lite::incoming_email for acs-mail-lite. This proc
    takes care of emails bounced back from mailer daemons. The required syntax for the To header
    is as follows: EnvelopPrefix-user_id-signature-package_id@myhost.com. This email was set for
    the Return-Path header of the original email. The signature is created by calculating the SHA
    value of the original Message-Id header. Thus an email is valid if the signature is correct and
    the user is known. If this is the case we record the bounce.

    # Use this callback implementation as a template for other packages.

    # This proc is called whenever an inbound email is pulled from the queue.
    #
    # System-wide bounces, vacation notices and other noise have already been
    # filtered out.

    # A package developer should just need to confirm input for their specific
    # package.

    # When supplied, package_id, object_id and party_id, other and datetime_cs
    # are passed in headers via a signed unique_id.
    # Values default to empty string.

    # headers_arr is an array of header values indexed by header name.
    # header names are in original uppercase and lowercase, which may
    # have some significance in filtering cases. Although case should
    # should not be relied on for obtaining a value.
    # Some header indexes are created by ACS Mail Lite procs during
    # processing. For example these indexes may be populated via
    # a unique id header created using acs_mail_lite::unique_id_create :
    #
    # aml_package_id contains package_id
    #
    # aml_object_id contains object_id
    #
    # aml_party_id contains party_id (usually same as user_id)
    #
    # aml_other contains other data useful as input
    #
    # aml_datetime_cs contains approx time in seconds since epoch when sent.
    #
    #
    # Other header names, and a description of their values, includes:
    #
    # aml_received_cs approx time in seconds since epoch when email received.
    # aml_subject     contains subject value.
    # aml_to          contents of 'to' header
    # aml_to_addrs    email address of 'to' header
    # aml_from        contents of 'from' header
    # aml_from_addrs  email address of 'from' header

    # For other created headers, see: acs_mail_lite::inbound_queue_pull_one
    # Header indexes may not exist for all cases.
    #

    # parts_arr  is an array that contains all the information about attached
    # or inline files and body contents.
