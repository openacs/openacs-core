Development notes and change log


Documentation changes are too numerous to deliniate.
General strategy is to separate into topics of:
setup, installation, inbound email, outbound email, legacy info and notes.


Portions of the following sources have been added to ACS Mail Lite docs:

http://openacs.org/xowiki/incoming_email
http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=543694

Some suggestions have been incorporated into new code.

A collection of example email headers are included.
Unit tests in acs-mail-lite/tcl/test/email-inbound-procs.tcl use these.
Ones from other sources on web are compatible
with OpenACS' distribution license and include attribution.
Each set of example email headers is in a separate file in this package:
 acs-mail-lite/www/doc/headers-example-N.txt
where N is a natural number.
