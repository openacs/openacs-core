    If no database driver is available, the acs-kernel libraries may not have
    been loaded (which is fine, since index.tcl will display a message
    instructing the user to install the database driver and restart the server
    before proceeding any further; in this case we won't use any procedures
    depending on the core libraries). Otherwise, all -procs.tcl files in
    acs-kernel (but not any -init.tcl files) will have been run.
