<p>This document provides a brief introduction to the design of the
templating system and the process of
building dynamic pages with the templating system.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The templating system solves a clear business need:
providing a system for efficient collaboration between designers and developers on
building a web site.
Writing a dynamic web page requires writing application logic
that retrieves data from a database and HTML markup that presents this
data in a readable form for the user.  In practice on production
sites, this requires collaboration between designers sensitive to
issues of usability and the user experience and developers who are sensitive to programming
and performance requirements.  Without a templating system, a single
script containing the application logic and presentation markup is
often authored by both a designer and a developer simultaneously.  
This is inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to maintain, as
multiple people with different purposes in mind must change the same file.
To solve this problem, the ACS Templating System, separates the
responsibilities of writing the page into separate application logic and
presentation layers.<p>

<h3>How the Templating System Works</h3>

<p>This separation is achieved through utilization of the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.  The MVC pattern is a classic design pattern that identifies
clear roles for components in GUI application with persistent data
originally developed for SmallTalk-80 by Steve Burbeck.
The <strong>model</strong> represents the object, its data, and
methods for updating the data.  The <strong>view</strong> provides a
user a UI to see and manipulate the data in the model.  The
<strong>controller</strong> provides the system necessary to connect
the model and the view to the user's requests.  This <a href="templating.jpg">diagram</a> summarizes how the process
flow of the templating system using the MVC
framework.  The filename <strong>dynamic-page</strong> is simply an
      example.</p>
    <p>
The <strong>model</strong> in the templating system is the
representation in the database of the <a
href="/doc/objects.html">ACS Objects</a> and their
associated PL/SQL package methods.  The <strong>view</strong> is the
ADP template that formats the datasources retrieved through the
controller into a presentation for a user.  The
<strong>controller</strong> is the combination of the <a
href="/doc/request-processor.html">Request Processor</a> and the
application logic pages implemented as .tcl scripts that prepare data
sources for the templating system.
      </p>
<p>
This framework permits a clear separation between the
logic that retrieves data from the database and the markup that
prepares the data for display.   The designer can
focus on presentation and usability issues and need only write HTML
markup.
The developer can
focus on the programming necessary to retrieve the data for the
designer and does not need to write HTML markup.  These tasks are
separated into separate files so that the two tasks do not interfere
with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
The design of the templating system makes it easier to include
reusable presentation components as <a href="components.html">included
templates</a> and <a href="master.html">master templates</a>, as
      explained in "<a href="composite.html">Composite Page</a>".
Moreover, the ACS Core pages are templated which enables
users of the ACS who want to customize their look and feel to update a
      site-wide master or the individual
templates without touching the application logic.  If a bug is fixed
in the application logic, the application logic script can be replaced
without affecting the template.
    </p>
    <p>  The rest of this document explains
the steps necessary to write a templated page.
</p>


<h3>Choose the data you wish to present</h3>

<p>The first step in building a dynamic page is to decide, at least to
a first approximation, on the data you wish to present to the user.
For example, a site that allows users to manage their car maintenance
records might want to present the following data on the user's home
page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user's name.
  <li>The user's city of residence.
  <li>A list of the user's cars, showing the year, make, and model.
  <li>A list of messages or alerts related to the user's cars.
  <li>A list of local events or special offers from mechanics or dealers.
</ul>

<p>Note that our definition of <em>data</em> encompasses
<em>everything that is unique to a particular user's experience</em>.
It does <em>not</em> include text or other layout features that will
appear the same for all users.</p>

<p>Each of the items in the above list constitutes a <em>data
source</em> which the system merges with a template to produce the
finished page.  The publisher typically describes the data to present
on each page as part of the site specification.</p>

<h3>Implement the Data Sources</h3>

    <p>
      Once the publishing team has described the data to present on a
      page, the developer writes a Tcl script to <a
      href="data.html">implement the data sources</a>.  The Tcl script
      should be located under the page root at the URL of the finished
      page.  For example, a dynamic page that will be located at
      <kbd>http://yoursite.com/cars.acs</kbd> requires a Tcl script
      located on the server at <kbd>/web/yoursite/www/cars.tcl</kbd> (or
      wherever your pages happen to be located).
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to setting data sources, the Tcl script may perform
      any other required tasks, such as checking permissions,
      performing database transactions or sending email.  It may also
      redirect to another URL if necessary.  The Tcl script may
      optionally use logic to change which page is being delivered,
      specified by <code>ad_return_template &lt;filename&gt;</code>.
      If no filename is supplied, <code>ad_return_template</code> does
      nothing.  If the page as defined after the last call to
      ad_return_template differs from what it was at the beginning of
      the page, its datasource preparation script is run <em>in the
      same scope</em>, in fact accumulating datasources.  By default
      the templating system looks for a file with the same name as the
      Tcl script, but for the template with the extension
      <strong>.adp</strong>.
    </p>

<h3>Document the Data Sources</h3>

<p>The developer should include comments in the Tcl code documenting
each data source.  A templating system specifies recognizes special <a
href="document.html">documentation directives</a> that allow the
comments to be extracted from the code and accessed by the designer or
publisher for reference.</p>

<h3>Write the Template</h3>

<p>The final step is to <a href="templates.html">write a template</a>
specifying the layout of the page.  Template files must have the
<kbd>adp</kbd> extension.  By default the system looks for the template
at the same location as the associated Tcl script, such as
<kbd>/web/yoursite/www/cars.adp</kbd>.

<p>The layout is mostly HTML, with a small number of additional custom
tags to control the presentation of dynamic data on the page.  In most
cases, the initial draft of the template will be written by the
developer in the course of testing the Tcl script.  The designer may
then enhance the layout as required.</p>
