<p>Most page layouts can be separated into smaller components, many
of which may appear in different contexts throughout a site.  Examples
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A box or section of the page listing contextual links related
      to the contents of the page.
  <li>A list of comments on the contents of the page.
  <li>A search box, user poll, or other small embedded form.
  <li>Reports and other administrative pages, where the employee may
      wish to assemble multiple panels of information on a single page.
  <li>Many popular portal sites allow users to customize their home pages
by choosing and arranging a set of small layout components within a
table grid.
</ul>

<p>The templating system makes it easy to build <a href="
	"composite.html"">reusable components</a> 
for any of the above scenarios.  The basic process is to build a
container template, which delineates the skeletal layout of the page.
Component templates may then be placed in the container template with
the <kbd>include</kbd> tag.  The container may pass arguments to the
components as needed for personalization or any other purpose.</p>
