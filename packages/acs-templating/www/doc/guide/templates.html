  <h2>Writing Templates</h2>
  <strong><a href="../index.html">Templating System</a> : User Guide</strong>
<hr>

<p>Templates are the primary means for separating the work of
developers and designers.  A template is written by a designer and
consists largely of static HTML (or other markup).  The template
author uses a small set of special markup tags to reference dynamic
data prepared by the developer.  A reasonably skilled template author
should be able to implement a template without any assistance from the
developer, other than assuring that the proper dynamic data is
accessible.</p>

<p>This document introduces the basic concepts underlying the use of
template tags in ACS 4.0.</p>

<h3>Variable Substitution</h3>

<p>Much like the mail merge feature of a word processor, template
authors must use special tags to position each piece of dynamic data
within the layout.  Each template is associated with a data dictionary
that lists all available variables.</p>

<p>See <a href="../tagref/variable.html">Variable Substitution</a>.</p>

<h3>Use of Components</h3>

<p>To speed development and ensure consistency of design, template
authors are encouraged to assemble pages from distinct component
templates that may be recycled in different contexts.  One typical
practice is to build a "master" template for an entire section of a
site, with a common header, footer and sidebar layout.  For each page
request, the "content" template is incorporated dynamically into a
specified area of the master template, usually a table cell.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to build small reusable templates that
may be included in other templates as logical components.  This may be
useful for common "widgets" such as search boxes or lists of related
links, as well as for building configurable portal pages where users
may assemble different types of content to their liking.</p>

<h3>Property Declarations</h3>

<p>Template authors need a simple mechanism for declaring properties
within the templates.  The most common use of such properties is for
configuring elements of an enclosing master template, such as the
title, navigation links, and whether to include a search box.  The
data dictionary specifies available properties as well as the set of
valid values when appropriate.</p>

<h3>Conditional Insertion</h3>

<p>Designers often need to tailor the layout depending on the specific
data being presented.  For example, when presenting a list of library
books that a user has checked out, the designer might want to
highlight the overdue ones in red.</p>

<p>See <a href="../tagref/if.html"><kbd>if..else</kbd></a>.</p>

<h3>Iteration</h3>

<p>Dynamic pages often present lists of values or records, each of
which typically represents the results of a database query.  Template
authors must have a way to iterate over each value or record in such a
list and format it appropriately.  In the simplest scenario, the exact
HTML is repeated with each iteration.  However, template authors often
need to vary the design depending on the context.  For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>First and last items may be formatted differently from items
         in between.</p>
  <li><p>Special breaks may be required when a particular value changes.
      For example, a query may return the name and office of all
      employees in a company, and the designer may wish to insert
      a subheading for each office.</p>
  <li><p>Colors or patterns may alternate between items.  For example,
      the designer may want to have alternate between white and gray bands
      in a table.</p>
</ol>

<p>To accommodate these type of scenarios, the template parser sets
some additional variables that the designer can reference to vary
the layout from item to item.</p>
