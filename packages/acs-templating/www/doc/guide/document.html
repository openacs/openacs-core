    <p>Effective coordination between the developer and designer is one of
      the major challenges of any publishing team.  The templating system
      provides a set of simple documentation directives so that developer
      comments on data sources can be extracted from Tcl scripts and
      summarized for non-technical members of the publishing team
      automatically.</p>
    
    <p>To take advantage of this capability, the developer must structure
      comments on a datasource in the following way:</p>
    <pre>
  # @datasource cars multirow
  # The cars owned by a user.
  # @column make The make of the car, i.e. Toyota
  # @column model The model of the car, i.e. Camry
  # @column year The year of manufacture
   
  # @datasource name onevalue
  # the name of the user
  
  # @data_input add_entry form
  # a form for adding entries to user's address book 
  # @input first_names text 
  # entry subject's first and middle names
  # @input last_name text
  # @input title text form of address for entry subject
  # @input birthday date birthdate w/ "MONTH DD YYYY" format
  # @input gender radio
  # either "m" for male or "f" for female
    </pre>
    <p>A few formatting guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> all datasources (onevalues, onelists, multilists, multirows) are documented with the
	datasource directive, their name, the type of datasource, and then necessary comments:
      </li>
      <blockquote><code># @datasource <em>name</em> &lt;<em>type of datasource</em>&gt; <em>comments</em></code></blockquote>
      <li> multirow datasources are followed with a series of column directives, column names, 
	and associated explanations:
      </li>
      <blockquote><code># @column <em>name</em> <em>comments</em></code></blockquote>
      <li> forms are documented with the data_input directive, and are also followed with 
	a series of input directives with the name and type of input widgets, and 
	necessary comments:
      </li>
      <blockquote><code># @data_input <em>name</em> form <em>comments</em> # @input <em>name</em> &lt;<em>type of form entry</em>&gt; <em>comments</em></code></blockquote>
      Possible form entry types include text (or textentry), date, checkbox,
      radio, select, multiselect and textbox
    </ul>
    <p>Once the templates have been enabled, the designer can simply visit
      the URL from which the page will be served, substituting <kbd>acs</kbd>
      with the <kbd>dat</kbd> extension.</p>
