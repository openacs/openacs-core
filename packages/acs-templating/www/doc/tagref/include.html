    <hr>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <tt>include</tt> tag is used to include a dynamic subtemplate
into the current template.  Subtemplates are evaluated in the same fashion
as any other dynamic template; the developer may associate data sources and
other properties to them.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>&lt;include src="subtemplate" attribute=value ...></pre>

or

<pre>&lt;include src="/packages/packagename/www/lib/subtemplate" attribute=value ...></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Arguments may be passed to the subtemplate by specifying
	  additional attributes to the <tt>include</tt> tag.  All
	  attributes except for <tt>src</tt> are assumed to be arguments
	  and are set as variables which the subtemplate may reference
	  using the <tt>var</tt> tag.  To pass a dynamic variable to the
	  subtemplate, specify the variable name surrounded by at signs as
	  the value:

	<pre>&lt;include src="subtemplate" source_id="@source_id@" ...></pre>

	To pass a datasource, e.g. <code>users</code>, by reference, use
	this notation:

	<pre>&lt;include src="subtemplate" &persons="users" ...></pre>

	This is particularly useful for passing onerow and multirow data
	sourced.  Note that in this case, if the subtemplate modifies the
	value this will affect the includer.  When the datasource in the
	included page has the same name (<code>&users="users"</code>), you
	can use the shorthand <code>&="users"</code>.
      </li>
     
      <li>
        It is important to note that variables passed through <tt>include</tt>
	become available to the .tcl and .adp files being include'd, but it 
	<b>does not</b> make them settable through <tt>ad_page_contract</tt>.
      
        <p>
	  So if you'd like to have a template that will return a fragment of a 
	  page that you'd like to include in other pages, make sure its .tcl 
	  component does not call <tt>ad_page_contract</tt>. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  If you'd like to include a full page (that is, one which calls 
	  <tt>ad_page_contract</tt>) then instead of passing a parameter through 
	  <tt>&lt;include&gt;</tt>, you could use 
	  <tt><a href="http://openacs.org/api-doc/proc-view?proc=rp%5fform%5fput">rp_form_put</a></tt>
	  to add the variable to that page's form. For additional 
	  references, see how message-chunk is used throughout the forums package.
	</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	If the <tt>src</tt> attribute begins with a slash, the path is
	assumed to be relative to the server root, the parent directory of
	the tcl library.  If not, the path is assumed to be relative to the
	<em>current template</em>, <em>not</em> the URL of the page
	request.</li>

      <li>If the page layout is sensitive to additional whitespace
	surrounding the subtemplate, then care must be taken that the
	subtemplate does not contain any blank lines at the beginning or
	end of the file.</li>
    </ul>
