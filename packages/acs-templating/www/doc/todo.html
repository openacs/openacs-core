<h3>Data Source API</h3>

<p>We need to resolve how onerow and multirow data sources are
represented internally, and plug in the proper API.  I originally used
ns_sets to represent rows in a data source (and continue to do so for
the time being).  jsalz instead uses arrays and lists to represent
rows.

Task: look at jsalz's data source code.
