    <h3>Results</h3>

    The measurements were taken on <code>dev0103-001</code> on 5
    October 2000, probably with acs-4-0-beta-R20001001.

    Here are the graphs for the 14 stages, titled by the log message
    of their beginning.

    <h4>Invoking preauth filter rp_filter</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage00.gif">
    <p>
    No difference; all take about 2.6 ms.  The same is the case for
    the few following stages: Short times and apparently independent
    of the kind of page.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking for node to match /acs-templating/admin/test/chain-frac-0.</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage01.gif">

    <h4>Found /acs-templating/.</h4>

    <h4>Performing developer support logging</h4>

    <h4>Checking for changed libraries</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage04.gif">

    <h4>Handling authentication</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage05.gif">

    <p>
    For some reason, this seems to take much longer on the Tcl-only
    page.  Maybe because it's the first in a triple of pages that
    e-Tester requests?  There may be a little longer time gap between
    chain-frac-2 and the next request of chain-frac-0
    </p>
    
    <h4>Handling authorization</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage06.gif">

    <p>
    An unexplained but clear distinction here: 0 is faster than 2, and 
    1 is slowest.
    </p>

    <h4>Done invoking preauth filter rp_filter (returning filter_ok)</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage07.gif">
    <h4>Invoking registered procedure rp_handler</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage08.gif">
    <h4>Searching for /webroot/web/brech/acs/packages/acs-templating/www/admin/test/chain-frac-0.*</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage09.gif">
    <h4>Serving /webroot/web/brech/acs/packages/acs-templating/www/admin/test/chain-frac-0.tcl with rp_handle_tcl_request</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage10.gif">
    <p>
    Here the actual work supposedly happens.  The Tcl-only page is
    clearly fastest.  Always reparsing pages expectedly affects the
    templated page, and -2, which compiles two ADP pages, is affected
    more than -1.  The benefit of -2, wrapping -1 in another include,
    isn't apparent; on the contrary, -1 is in all cases a bit faster
      than -2.  The benefit of cacheing seems more than offset by the
      extra complexity of nesting several templates.
    </p>

    <h4>Invoking trace filter ad_issue_deferred_dml</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage11.gif">
    <p>
    For some reason, the Tcl-only page takes significantly longer.
    </p>
    <h4>Done invoking trace filter ad_issue_deferred_dml (returning filter_ok)</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage12.gif">
    <h4>Invoking trace filter ds_trace_filter</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage13.gif">
    <p>
    That last phase is ended by <strong>
      Done invoking trace filter ds_trace_filter (returning filter_ok)</strong>
    </p>
    <h4>Total time</h4>
    <img src="time1/stage14.gif">
    <p>
    Overall, the templated pages are delivered <strong>faster</strong>.  Forcing
    the template system to always reread all files and to recompile
    the ADP part slows them down, as expected, but overall they are
    still faster than the Tcl-only page.
