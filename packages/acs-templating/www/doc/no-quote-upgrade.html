    <h2>Upgrading existing ADPs to noquote templating</h2>

    <h3>Introduction.</h3>

    The variable substitution in the templating has been changed to
    become more friendly towards quoting.  The rationale for the
    change and the definition of terms like <i>quoting</i> are present
    in <a href="no-quote.html">the quoting article</a>.  As it discusses these
    concepts in some depths, we see no reason to repeat them here.
    Instead, we will assume that you have read the previous article
    and focus on the topic of this one: the changes you need to apply
    to make your module conformant to the new quoting rules.

    <p>
      This text is written as a result of our efforts to make the ACS
      installation for the German Bank project work, therefore it is
      based on field experience rather than academic discussion.  We
      hope you will find it useful.

    <h3>Recap of the Theory.</h3>

    The change to the templating system can be expressed in one
    sentence:

    <blockquote>
      All variables are now quoted by default, except those explicitly
      protected by <tt>;noquote</tt> or <tt>;literal;</tt>.
    </blockquote>

    This means that the only way your code can fail is if the new code
    quotes a variable which is not meant to be quoted.  Which is where
    <tt>;noquote</tt> needs to be added.  That's all porting effort
that is required. Actually, the variables are subject to
HTML-quoting and internationalization. The suffix <tt>;noquote</tt>
means that the variable's content will be internationalized, but not
HTML-quoted, while <tt>;no18n</tt> means quote, but don't
    internationalize. Finally <tt>;literal</tt> means: don't quote and
    don't internationalize.



    <p>
      This is not hard because most variables will not be affected by
      this change.  Most variables either need to be quoted (those
      containing textual data that comes from the database or from the
      user) or are unaffected by quoting (numerical database IDs,
      etc.)  The variables where this behavior is undesired are
      <b>those that contain HTML</b> which is expected to be included
      as part of the page, and <b>those that are already quoted</b> by
      Tcl code.  Such variables should be protected from quoting by
      the <tt>;noquote</tt> modifier.

    <p>

    <h3>The Most Common Cases.</h3>

    The most common cases where you need to add <tt>;noquote</tt> to
    the variable name are easy to recognize and identify.

    <p>
      <b>Hidden form variables.</b>
      <br>
      Also known as "hidden input fields", hidden form variables are
      form fields with pre-defined values which are not shown to the
      user.  These days they are used for transferring internal state
      across several form pages.  In HTML, hidden form variables look
      like this:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input name=var1 value="value1"&gt;
  &lt;input name=var2 value="value2"&gt;
  ... real form stuff ...
&lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    ACS has a convenience function for creating hidden form variables,
    <tt>export_form_vars</tt>.  It accepts a list of variables and
    returns the HTML code containing the hidden input tags that map
    variable names to variable values, as found in the Tcl
    environment.  In that case, the Tcl code would set the HTML code
    to a variable:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
set form_vars [export_vars -form {var1 var2}]
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    The ADP will simply refer to the <tt>form_vars</tt> variable:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;form&gt;
  @form_vars@              &lt;!-- WRONG!  Needs noquote --&gt;
  ... real form stuff ...
&lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    This will no longer work as intended because <tt>form_vars</tt>
    will be, like any other variable, quoted, and the user will end up
    seeing raw HTML text of the hidden variables.  Even worse, the
    browser will not be aware of these form fields, and the page will
    not work.  After protecting the variable with <tt>;noquote</tt>,
    everything works as expected:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;form&gt;
  @form_vars;noquote@
  ... real form stuff ...
&lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Snippets of HTML produced by Tcl code, aka
      <i>widgets</i></b>.
      <br>
      Normally we try to fit all HTML code into the ADP template and
      have the Tcl code handle the "logic" of the program.  And yet,
      sometimes pieces of relatively convoluted HTML need to be
      included in many templates.  In such cases, it makes sense to
      generate the <i>widget</i> programmatically and include it into
      the template as a variable.  A typical widget is a date entry
      widget which provides the user the input and selection boxes for
      year, month, and day, all of which default to the current date.
      <p>
      Another example of widgets is the <i>context bar</i> often found
      on top of ACS pgages.
      <p>
      Obviously, all widgets should be treated as HTML and therefore
      adorned with the <tt>;noquote</tt> qualifier.  This also assumes
      that the routines that <em>build</em> the widget are correctly
      written and that they will quote the <i>components</i> used to
      build the widget.

    <p>
      <b>Pieces of text that are already quoted.</b>
      <br>
      This quoting is usually part of a more general preparation for
      HTML rendering of the text.  For instance, a bboard posting can
      be either HTML or text.  If it is HTML, we transmit it as is; if
      not, we perform quoting, word-wrapping, etc.  In both cases it
      is obvious that quoting performed by the templating system would
      be redundant, so we must be careful to add <tt>;noquote</tt> to
      the ADP.

    <h3>The <tt>property</tt> and <tt>include</tt> Gotchas.</h3>

    Transfer of parameters between included ADPs often requires manual
    addition of <tt>;noquote</tt>.  Let's review why.
    <p>
      The <tt>property</tt> tag is used to pass a piece of information
      to the master template.  This is used by the ADP whose writer
      consciously chose to let the master template handle a variable
      given by the Tcl code.  Typically page titles, headings, and
      context bars are handled this way.  For example:

    <blockquote>
      <b>master:</b>
      <pre>
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;@title@&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#ffffff"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;@heading@&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;slave&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
      </pre>
      <b>slave:</b>
      <pre>
&lt;master&gt;
&lt;property name="title"&gt;@title@&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property name="heading"&gt;@title@&lt;/property&gt;
...
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    The obvious intention of the master is to allow its slave
    templates to provide a "title" and a "heading" of the page in a
    standardized fashion.  The obvious intention of our slave template
    is to allow its corresponding Tcl code to set a single variable,
    <tt>title</tt>, which will be used for both title and heading.
    What's wrong with this code?

    <p>
      The problem is that title gets quoted <em>twice</em>, once by
      the slave template, and once by the master template.  This is
      the result of how the templating system works: <em>every</em>
      occurrence of <tt>@<var>variable</var>@</tt> is converted to
      <tt>[ad_quotehtml&nbsp;$<var>variable</var>]</tt>, even when it
      is used only to set a property and you would expect the quoting
      to be suppressed.

    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <font size=-1>
	Implementation note: Ideally, the templating system should
	avoid this pitfall by quoting the variable (or not) only once,
	at the point where the value is passed from the Tcl code to
	the templating system.  However, no such point in time exists
	because what in fact happens is that the template gets compiled
	into code that simply <i>takes</i> what it needs from the
	environment and <i>then</i> does the quoting.  Properties are
	passed to the master so that all the property variables are
	shoved into an environment; by the time the master template is
	executed, all information on which variable came from where
	and whether it might have already been quoted is lost.
      </font>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This occurrence is often referred to as <i>over-quoting</i>.
      Over-quoting is sometimes hard to detect because things seem to
      work fine in most cases.  To notice the problem in the example
      above (and in any other over-quoting example), the title needs
      to contain one of the characters <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt> or
      <tt>&amp;</tt>.  If it does, they will appear quoted to the user
      instead of appearing as-is.

    <p>
      Over-quoting is resolved by adding <tt>;noquote</tt> to one of
      the variables.  We strongly recommend that you add
      <tt>;literal</tt> inside the <tt>property</tt> tag rather than
      in the master.  The reason is that, first, it makes sense to do
      so because conceptually the master is the one that "shows" the
      variable, so it makes sense that it gets to quote it.  Secondly,
      a <tt>property</tt> tag is supposed to merely <em>transfer</em>
      a piece of text to the master; it is much cleaner and more
      maintainable if this transfer is defined to be non-lossy.  This
      becomes important in practice when there is a hierarchy of
      <tt>master</tt> templates -- e.g. one for the package and one
      for the whole site.

    <p>
      To reiterate, a bug-free version of the slave template looks
      like this:

    <blockquote>
      <b>slave sans over-quoting:</b>
      <pre>
&lt;master&gt;
&lt;property name="doc(title)"&gt;@title;literal@&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property name="heading"&gt;@title;literal@&lt;/property&gt;
...
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The exact same problems when the <tt>include</tt> statement
      passes some text.  Here is an example:

    <blockquote>
      <b>Including template:</b>
      <pre>
&lt;include src="user-kick-form" id=@kicked_id@ reason=@default_reason@&gt;
      </pre>
      <b>Included template:</b>
      <pre>
&lt;form action="do-kick" method=POST&gt;
  Kick user @name@.&lt;br&gt;
  Reason: &lt;textarea name=reason&gt;@reason@&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type=submit value="Kick"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    Here an include statement is used to include an HTML form widget
    parts of which are defined with Tcl variables <tt>$id</tt> and
    <tt>$default_reason</tt> whose values presumably come from the
    database.

    <p>
      What happens is that <var>reason</var> that prefills the
      <tt>textarea</tt> is over-quoted.  The reasons are the same as
      in the last example: it gets quoted once by the includer, and
      the second time by the included page.  The fix is also similar:
      when you transfer non-constant text to an included page, make
      sure to add <tt>;literal</tt>.

    <blockquote>
      <b>Including template, sans over-quoting:</b>
      <pre>
&lt;include src="user-kick-form" id=@kicked_id;literal@ reason=@default_reason;literal@&gt;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Upgrade Overview.</h3>

    Upgrading a module to handle the new quoting rules consists of
    applying the process mentioned above to every ADP in the module.
    Using the knowledge gained above, we can specify exactly what
    needs to be done for each template.  The items are sorted
    approximately by frequency of occurrence of the problem.

    <ol>
      <li>
	Audit the template for variables that export form variables
	and add <tt>;noquote</tt> to them.
	<p>
      <li>
	More generally, audit the template for variables that are
	known to contain HTML, e.g. those that contain widgets or HTML
	content provided by the user.  Add <tt>;noquote</tt> to them.
	<p>
      <li>
	Add <tt>;literal</tt> to variables used inside the
	<tt>property</tt> tag.
	<p>
      <li>
	Add <tt>;noquote</tt> to textual variables whose values are
	attributes to the <tt>include</tt> tag.
	<p>
      <li>
	Audit the template for occurrences of
	<tt>&lt;%=&nbsp;[ns_quotehtml&nbsp;@<var>variable</var>@]&nbsp;=></tt>
	and replace them with <tt>@<var>variable</var>@</tt>.
	<p>
      <li>
	Audit the Tcl code for occurrences of <tt>ns_quotehtml</tt>.
	If it is used to build an HTML component, leave it, but take
	note of the variable the result gets saved to.  Otherwise,
	remove the quoting.
	<p>
      <li>
	Add <tt>;noquote</tt> to the "HTML component" variables noted
	in the previous step.
    </ol>

    After that, test that the template behaves as it should, and
    you're done.

    <h3>Testing.</h3>

    Fortunately, most of the problems with automatic quoting are very
    easy to diagnose.  The most important point for testing is that it
    covers as many cases as possible: ideally testing should cover all
    the branches in all the templates.  But regardless of the quality
    of your coverage, it is important to know how to conduct proper
    testing for the quoting changes.  Here are the cases you need to
    watch out for.

    <ul>
      <li><b>HTML junk appearing in the page.</b><br>
	Literal HTML visible to the user typically comes from an
	"<tt>export_form_vars</tt>" or a widget variable that lacks
	<tt>;noquote</tt>.  To fix the problem, simply add
	<tt>;noquote</tt> to the variable.
	<p>
      <li>
	<b>Over-quoting and under-quoting.</b><br>
	To detect quoting defects, you need to assume an active role
	in naming your objects.  The best way to do it is to create
	objects (bboard forums, messages, news items, etc.) with names
	that contain the representation of an entity,
	e.g. "<tt>&amp;copy;</tt>".  This looks like the copyright
	SGML entity, and intentionally so.  The testing consists of
	checking that the browser prints exactly what you typed in as
	the name.  Thus if your forum/message/etc. is listed as
	"<tt>&amp;copy;</tt>", everything is OK.  If it is listed as
	"<tt>&amp;amp;copy;</tt>", it means that the string was quoted
	twice, i.e. over-quoted.  Finally, if the entity is
	interpreted (shown as &copy;), it means that the string lacks
	quoting, i.e. it is under-quoted.

	<p>
	  To get rid of over-quoting, make sure that the variables
	  don't get quoted in <em>transport</em>, such as in the
	  <tt>property</tt> tag or as an attribute of the
	  <tt>include</tt> tag.  Also, make sure that your Tcl code is
	  not quoting the variable name.

	<p>
	  To get rid of under-quoting, make sure that your variable
	  gets quoted exactly once.  This can be achieved either by
	  removing a (presumably overzealous) <tt>;noquote</tt> or by
	  quoting the string from Tcl.  The latter is necessary when
	  building HTML components, such as a context bar, from
	  strings that come from the database or from the user.
    </ul>
