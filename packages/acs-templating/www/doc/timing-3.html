    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>
      The measurements were taken on <code>reusia.boston</code> on 17
      October 2000, with tarball acs-3-4-6-R20001008.  Templating
      under 3.4 is quite different; instead of a .tcl script,
      datasources are defined in a .data file that has a different XML 
      syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have graphs for 9 stages only.  While Tcl pages generate
      four more entries, these lack from templated pages, and hence I
      suppressed them.  The log message that marks
      the beginning of each phase is written in the lower right of the
      graphs.  Each curve curve plots 288 page requests.  As I didn't
      back port of the configurable cache refreshing stragegy ('never' or
      'always'), I show all graphs in the 'normal' colors.  The label
      is 'do', though.

      To show off the graphing method, compare the graph above with the one
      below, which only uses the first 32 measurements.  The curves are less
      smooth, but the message is the same.

    <p>
      In ACS 3.4.6, Tcl-only pages are sereved <strong>faster</strong> than in
      4.0 beta-2.  The templated pages are delivered much <strong>slower</strong>.
      The first time the template system reads a templated page, it
      takes about 3 seconds!  The result is cached, mitigating the
      problem a lot.
