<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>This series of exercises is meant as a learning tool for any web graphic designer
wanting or needing to understand how the ACS Templating System, or ATS,  works, and
how to use it in building web pages.

<p>First, perhaps an explanation of what the templating system does will help us understand
how it works.  An ATS template itself serves as a reusable, unchanging framework that delivers
dynamic data.  The advantage to this is something you probably already realize: you need only build 
and edit a few pages to maintain a consistent presentation style while accommodating numerous permutaions of changing data.

<p>This training module will teach largely by exercise and example, but you should also
refer regularly to the <a href="../index.html">ATS documents</a> provided and more specific pointers will be given to help you out along the way.

<p>Okay, let's get to the nitty gritty.

<h3><a name="exercises">Exercises</a></h3>

<p>The basic building block of dynamic data in a template is the onevalue variable.
A <a href="../tags/variable.html">variable</a> is simply a tag used in your
<code>.adp</code> file that holds data supplied by another source file; that source will probably
be another file of the same name with a <code>.tcl</code> extension.  Variable tags come in 
three basic formats, as <a href="../tags/list.html">lists</a>, 
<a href="../tags/multiple.html">multiples</a> and onevalues.

<p>

<strong>Exercise 1: Onevalues, onelists, multilists and multirows</strong><br>
(nestedlists, too?)
<p>
Let's first take a look at some list and variable tags in action.  Open up another
browser and look at <a href="list-and-var-sample.txt">this page</a>, which is a
text rendition of the <code>/ats/doc/exercise/list-and-var-sample.tcl</code>
page we'll be sourcing our data from; at the top of the page you'll find a block of commented
text describing the variables generated by this page, followed by the actual code itself.
Now, using your preferred text editor, open the file
<code>list-and-var-sample.adp</code> located in the same directory and compare the html script
that you see there
with the final user-viewed page, <code><a href="list-and-var-sample.acs">
list-and-var-sample.acs</a></code>.  Almost every .acs page the user sees is supported by one
.tcl file which supplies the data to be shown, and one .adp file specifying the format of it's 
presentation.  Compare what you see in <code>list-and-var-sample.acs</code> with its supporting .adp
file and make note of the textual and structural differences between
the two, specifically:
<ul>
<li><a href="../tags/variable.html">variables</a> in the <code>.adp</code> file are designated with "@" markers, like the
    <code>@name@</code> variable that litters the opening text block of <code>list-and-var-sample.adp</code>; here,
    <code>@name@</code> is used as a place-marker for the value set in <code>list-and-var.sample.tcl</code></li>
<li>the variables within the <a href="../tags/multiple.html">&lt;multiple&gt;</a> tag,
    though only appearing once in the
    .adp file, are cycled repeatedly to show multiple sets of information when displayed in
    <code>list-and-var-sample.acs</code>; example:
    <blockquote><code><pre>
    &lt;multiple name="<em>your_multirow</em>"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;@<em>your_multirow</em>.first_names@ @<em>your_multirow</em>.last_name@ &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/multiple&gt;
    </pre></code></blockquote>
    The user will see one table row filled with a different person's name for each row contained in the multirow
    <code><em>your_multirow</em></code>.
    </li>
<li>multirow variables are identified with this format: @&lt;name of the multirow&gt;.&lt;name
    of a field in the multirow&gt;@, and can only be called within their respective
    <code>&lt;multiple&gt;</code> tags</li>
</ul>
<p>

You probably noticed some other funky looking tags, too, but ignore those for now.

<p>
Now since the variable marker <code>@name@</code> is set in <code>
list-and-var-sample.tcl</code>,
you can go ahead and edit that file to replace "<code>(Your Name)</code>" 
with whatever your name really is
(be sure to leave the quotes); if you wish,edit some of the other values 
to personalize the page.  You'll
see your changes take effect upon saving the .tcl file and
reloading <code>list-and-var-sample.acs</code>.  In general, 
though, you should probably not be
editing .tcl files unless you have a pretty good sense of their innerworkings.

<p>

Okay, now go back to the web browser in which you 
are viewing <code>list-and-var-sample.acs</code>
and change the ".acs" extension to "<a href="list-and-var-sample.dat">.dat</a>".
This page displays a view of datasources generated in the
.tcl file that can be used in your .adp template 
(actually, the information is generated from commented
text parsed from the top of the .tcl file, so you can 
view this information in either the .dat page or
straight from the .tcl file).  Go ahead and make use of the 
datasource variables not already included
in the .adp file; specifically, change <code>list-and-var-sample.adp</code> so that:
<ul>
  <li>your personal phone number information is included
  <li>each of your friends' names serves as a hyperlink that 
  allows the viewer to email your friend</li>
  <li>a listing of recently watched movies and your reactions 
  to them follows after the information about your friends</li>      
  <li>also, note that the use of any variable tags referring to 
  variables not declared in the .tcl file will break the .acs page</li>
</ul>
<p>
Congratulations!  You've just created a personalized web 
page describing friends you've never met
and movies you've possibly never seen.

<p>
<strong>Exercise Two: &lt;if&gt; and &lt;else&gt;, the conditional tags</strong>
<p>
Dynamic data implies a changing page, and also changing presentation.  
The <a href="../tags/if.html">&lt;if&gt;</a> and &lt;else&gt; tags allow 
you to alter the format of your page to accommodate data changes.  The 
function of &lt;if&gt;
is straightforward enough: given a condition -- such as @x@ equals 5 -- 
all the text/html/dynamic data between the the opening 
and closing &lt;if&gt; tags will be displayed if and only if @x@ does in fact 
equal 5.  A complete listing of currently
supported conditions and some brief explanatory notes can be 
found <a href="../tags/if.html">here</a>.  Also, a few more things to keep in mind:

<ul>
  <li>in Tcl all variables, even numbers, are stored as text 
  strings with quantitative values, so 
  conditions like less than, greater than, and (not) between can also 
  be used with text to determine alphabetical order: <em>a</em> &lt; <em>b</em> &lt; ... &lt; 
  <em>z</em>, lower-case letters are greater than upper-case, and numbers less than letters.  
  Example: "you" are greater than "me", and "I" am less than "you"</li>

  <li>the "between" conditions checks inclusively, so &lt;if 2 between 2 6&gt; 
will test true</li>

  <li><code>&lt;if @a@ between @b@ @c@&gt;</code> requires that <code>@a@</code>
      is greater than or equal to <code>@b@</code>
      <em>and</em> less than or equal to <code>@c@</code>; so <code>&lt;if
      @x@ between 4 2&gt;</code> will always test false</li>

  <li>the "in" condition uses a regular expression check (or will it? <font color=red>come
  back here and revise</font>) 
</ul>
      <p>

Now, alter a few of the &lt;if&gt; tags in <code>list-and-var-samle.adp</code> and add a few 
of your own.  Specifically, add one &lt;if&gt; and &lt;else&gt; combination so that the friend
description reads "likes chocolate" when <code>likes_chocolate_p</code> is "t", 
"doesn't like chocolate" when <code>likes_chocolate_p</code> is "f", or 
"probably like chocolate" if <code>likes_chocolate_p</code> is an empty string.  
Also, add one &lt;if&gt;, and one &lt;if&gt; only, so that <em>a</em> is appropriately
changed to <em>an</em> for any 11-, 18- or 80- to 89-year olds.

<p>
<strong>Exercise Three: The &lt;master&gt; and &lt;slave&gt; tags -- a call to the dominatrix in you</strong>
<p>
The <a href="../tags/master.html">&lt;master&gt;</a> and <a href="../tags/slave.html">
&lt;slave&gt;</a> tags allow you to maintain a consistent style and format among pages
without having to edit each page individually.  To get a sense of what these tags do 
and how they work, go ahead and run through this short <a href="slave-sample.acs">
demonstration</a>, and then use a text editor to view the related .adp files.  Also, read 
<a href="../guide/master.html">this discussion</a> on the use of master pages.

<p>

One thing you may have noticed earlier about <code>list-and-var-sample.adp</code>
is that it lacks the
standard &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags.  This is because
<code>list-and-var-sample.adp</code> is, as indicated by the &lt;master&gt;
tag at the top of the file,
also a slave section, contained within <code>master-sample.adp</code>.

<p>

Let me stress a few key points you might have already picked up on from the 
demonstration and upon examining the .adp files, and add a few pointers:
<ul>
  <li>the &lt;slave&gt; tag indicates where on the master page the slave 
  section is inserted</li>
  <li>slave pages indicate the source of the master file with the &lt;master&gt;
      tag, referring by the file name only, and not including its ".adp" extension</li>
  <li>as mentioned earlier, slave sections do not require &lt;html&gt;, 
  &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;
      tags when contained within a master tag already formatted for HTML</li>
  <li>as the demonstration points out, pages are browsed at the .acs page 
  sharing the same file name
      as the slave, not master</li>
  <li>the master page can be viewed at its own .acs page, but shows nothing in
      place of the &lt;slave&gt; tag</li>
  <li>you can have nested slave sections, that is, a slave section within another slave</li> 
  <li>you <strong>cannot</strong> have two different slave sections within the same master (go ahead
      and try adding an extra &lt;slave&gt; tag to a master page to see what happens)</li> 
  <li><a href="../tags/property.html">&lt;property&gt;</a> tags are used within a slave section
      to pass text, HTML and references to local datasources up to the master page; these values
      are placed in the master page in the same fashion as onevalues</li>
  <li>data and HTML can be passed from a nested slave section to its uber-master by using
      one &lt;property&gt; tag on each intermediate page</li>
  <li>if a variable set in the Tcl file of a master page shares 
  the same name as a variable declared
  within the slave section's &lt;property&gt; tag, the master value 
  overrides the slave's (unless the Tcl code checks for pre-existing information)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now that the secrets of &lt;master&gt; and &lt;slave&gt; have been revealed, it's time to put
a little of your newfound knowledge to use.  Open up 
<a href="form-sample.acs"><code>form-sample.adp</code></a>, a
standalone, independently formatted html page, and enslave it to the mastery of
of your personal web page. It would also be nice 
if you were to label the newly inserted form
with some slave-specific title.

<p>
<strong>Exercise Four: The functions of &lt;formtemplate&gt;</strong><br>
<p>
Creating forms with ATS can be as simple as inserting two tags into a page.  Try this:
open <code>form-sample.adp</code> and add the two following ATS tags:
<blockquote>
<code><kbd>
<a href="../tags/formtemplate.html">&lt;formtemplate id="add_entry"&gt;&lt;/formtemplate&gt;</a>
</kbd></code>
</blockquote>
<p>
Save the page and reload it.  You should see now see a big baby-blue form block; this is the
ATS default style for form presentation.  Aside from requiring no HTML code, the 
&lt;formtemplate&gt; default has the added convenience of automated entry validation
with appropriate correction requests.  Test this out by trying to submit a form without
including first or last name or gender information.

<p>
However, if ever you wish
to build a form according to the mandates of your own taste, &lt;formtemplate&gt; 
also leaves you this option. Manually 
stylizing forms with ATS requires you to
learn only two more tags, <a href="../tags/formwidget.html">&lt;formwidget&gt;</a> and 
<a href="../tags/formgroup.html">&lt;formgroup&gt;</a>.  Browse through the ATS 
<a href="../../demo">demo</a> for examples of &lt;formwidget&gt; and &lt;formwidget&gt;
usage.  For the most part &lt;formwidget&gt; should be used in most places you might have used
&lt;select&gt; or &lt;input&gt; in plain HTML, save for &lt;input&gt; checkboxes and radio buttons, 
which should be replaced with the &lt;formgroup&gt; tag.  When working with ATS you 
should probably refrain from using plain &lt;input&gt; and &lt;select&gt; 
tags altogether.  

<p>

You may have already noticed a few &lt;formwidget&gt; and &lt;formgroup&gt; in use
within the block of HTML and ATS text commented out in <code>form-sample.adp</code>.  Go
ahead and put that block of HTML/ATS code into action by removing the comment tag wrapper 
and deleting the <code>&lt;/formtemplate&gt;</code> tag; you should now see 
a hand-built version of the same form.

<p>

There are noticeable differences between the two form templates, most obviously
the lack of background color and a few missing entry fields in the manually 
constructed one.  Maybe not so noticeable
is the grouping of entry widgets into one HTML table row (check out the <em>Name</em> field) and
the multi-input combination of text entry boxes and radio buttons for entering telephone number
information.  Take a look at how the phone information entry section is constructed in <code>
form-sample.adp</code>.  Note specifically: &lt;formgroup&gt; is somewhat similar to 
the &lt;multiple&gt; tag in that the block of ATS 
code contained within the &lt;formgroup&gt; tags will
be parsed into plain HTML once for each &lt;formgroup&gt; value option.

<p>

Practice using &lt;formwidget&gt; and &lt;formgroup&gt; by adding the missing entry fields manually
into the form.  Make free use of any HTML properties to streamline the form to your liking.  
If you can't remember what those fields were you can replace the closing 
&lt;/formtemplate&gt; tag to recover the default format, or make use of the .dat datasource page
to view your developer's description and comments about the form.
<p>
Also, try customizing your form's error response/correction request text.  
You'll need to use the <a href="../tags/formerror.html">&lt;formerror&gt;</a>
tag, an example of which can be found under the gender formwidget.  

<p>

<strong>Exercise Five: more fun with multirows</strong>
<p>
Now that you've confidently added the conditional &lt;if&gt; and &lt;else&gt; tags to
your ATS toolbelt, it's time to put those tools to good use in formatting
multirow data.  First, read the <a href="../tags/multiple.html">docs</a> to learn about
the automatcally generated <code>@<em>your_multirow</em>.rownum@</code> column,
the <code>@<em>your_multirow</em>:rowcount@</code> onevalue which contains
the total number of rows contained in your multirow, and the &lt;multiple&gt; <code>startrow</code>
and <code>maxrows</code> attributes.  Possible point of confusion: the variable 
<code>@<em>your_multirow</em>:rowcount@</code> is a onevalue and not a column of the 
multirow <code><em>your_multirow</em></code>, so it need not be used within &lt;multiple&gt;
tags and in many cases should not be used within &lt;multiple&gt; tags.  Why is this?  (Take 
a look at how <code>@address:rowcount@</code> is used.)

Now make the following improvements to the
address book listing you found in <code>form-sample.acs</code>:

<ul>
<li>stripe the table with banded rows of alternating grey and white, or some other color scheme of
your preference</li>
<li>use the <code>startrow</code> attribute so that the address book listing begins at a rownumber
determined by the Tcl file code (check the .dat page)</li>
<li>add navigation links to the address book so that users can move forward or back between row
listings, or jump to the beginning or end of their address book</li>
<ul>
<li> each link should set the url variable that determines the first row of the set to be displayed
<li> the links should only appear when necessary, that is, a link pointing towards the next
set of rows should not appear if the user is already viewing rows 1-5 of 5 total rows.
</ul>
</ul>
