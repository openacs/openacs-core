  <h2>Parsing Templates in Memory</h2>
  <strong><a href="../index.html">Templating System</a></strong>
<hr>

<p>The templating system code is oriented towards parsing templates
stored in the file system, in conjunction with a Tcl script that is
also stored as a file.  However, when the template is not actually
stored in the file system, you will need to parse it as a string in
memory.  Two common situations in which this occurs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Templates are stored in the database.
  <li>Templates are generated dynamically, possibly based in turn on a "style"
      template.  This is how ATS auto-generates forms.
</ul>

<h3>The Parsing Process</h3>

<p>Whether the template is ultimately stored in a file or not, the
templating system follows the same basic process during the parsing
process:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Prepare data sources.</em>  Some Tcl code is evaluated to 
      prepare data sources (scalars, lists, multirow data structures)
      for merging with the template.  (For file-based templates the 
      interpreted code is cached in a procedure after the first time).

  <li><em>Compile the template.</em>. The template markup is compiled
      into a chunk of Tcl code that builds the page into a single
      output string.  (For file-based templates the resulting
      code is cached in a procedure after the first time).

  <li><em>Evaluate the compiled template</em>.  The template code is
      evaluated in the same stack frame as the data source code, so
      that all variables declared as data sources are directly
      available to the template.  The result of the evaluation step
      is a single string, which normally is written to the connection.
</ol>

<h3>How to Parse Templates in Memory</h3>

<p>The templating system provides a low-level API that allows you
to perform the three steps described above in the context of your
own code:</p>

<blockquote><pre><font color="green"># set up any number of data sources:</font>

set first_name George

query cars multirow "
  select make, model from cars where first_name = :first_name"

<font color="green"># get the template.  This may be a static string, be queried from the
# database, generated dynamically, etc.</font>

set template "
Hello @first_name@!

&lt;multiple name=cars>
  @cars.rownum@. @cars.make@ @cars.model@&lt;br>
&lt;/multiple>
"

<font color="green"># compile the template.  The templating system takes the
# result of this step and wraps it in a proc so that it is 
# bytecode-cached in the interpreter.  You may wish to implement
# some sort of simple caching here as well.</font>

set code [template::adp_compile -string $template]

<font color="green"># evaluate the template code.  Note that you pass a <em>reference</em>
# to the variable containing the code, not the value itself.  The code
# is evaluated in the calling stack frame (by uplevel) so that
# the above data sources are directly accessible.</font>

set output [template::adp_eval code]

<font color="green"># now use the output however you wish</font>
      </pre></blockquote>

<h3>Generating Templates from Other Templates</h3>

<p>In some cases, the template itself may be based on yet another base
template.  For example, the templating system itself generates form
templates based on a generic "style" template.  The generic template
primarily depends on a single data source, <kbd>elements</kbd>, which
references the element list for a particular form object.  A single
<kbd>multiple</kbd>loop</kbd> is used to lay out the specific
<kbd>formwidget</kbd> and <kbd>formgroup</kbd> tags, along with labels and
validation text, for the form.  The output of this first step is then
rendered into HTML and returned to the user.</p>

<p>Note that the generic "style" template contains templating tags
(<kbd>formwidget</kbd>, <kbd>formgroup</kbd>, <kbd>if</kbd> etc.) that must
be "protected" during the first step.  The templating system provides 
the <a href="../tagref/noparse.html"><kbd>noparse</kbd></a> tag to do this.</p>
