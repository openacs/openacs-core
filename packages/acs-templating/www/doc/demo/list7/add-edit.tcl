  Example script that allows for the creation or editing of a simple note
  object type, using ad_form and package Tcl API tools.

# When using ad_form to generate or edit acs_objects, the object type's
# key column must be specified in ad_page_contract as is done above,
# and defined with the type "key" in ad_form.  This enables the use of
# the various request and submission code blocks.
