  <body>
    The template system introduces no new mechanisms for comments.
    You can use
    HTML comments      (<!-- users doing "View Page Source" will see this -->)
    and Tcl comments   (<%#  but they can never look at that               %>).
    <br>
    Neither are visible on the HTML page.
