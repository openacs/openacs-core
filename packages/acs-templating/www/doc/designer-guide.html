<h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>Templates are the primary means for separating the work of
developers and designers.  A template is written by a designer and
consists largely of static HTML (or other markup).  The template
author uses a small set of special markup tags to reference dynamic
data prepared by the developer.The tags allow authors to accomplish four basic tasks that are not
possible with standard HTML:</p>

<ul>

<li>Embed a dynamic variable in a template 
(<kbd><a href="tagref/variable.html">var</a></kbd>).

<li>Repeat a template section for each object in a dynamic list of objects
(<kbd><a href="tagref/multiple.html">multiple</a></kbd>, 
 <kbd><a href="tagref/grid.html">grid</a></kbd>).

<li>Output different template sections depending on the value of one or more
dynamic variables (<kbd><a href="tagref/if.html">if</a></kbd>).

<li>Provide a mechanism for building complete pages from multiple
component templates 
(<kbd><a href="tagref/include.html">include</a></kbd>).

</ul>

    <p>
      A reasonably skilled template author should be able to implement
      a template without any assistance from the developer, other than
      assuring that the proper dynamic data is accessible.
    </p>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<p>This section introduces the basic concepts underlying the use of
template tags in ACS 4.0.</p>

<h4>Variable Substitution</h4>

<p>Much like the mail merge feature of a word processor, template
authors must use special tags to position each piece of dynamic data
within the layout.  Each template is associated with a data dictionary
that lists all available data sources.</p>

<p>See <a href="tagref/variable.html">Variable Substitution</a>.</p>

<h4>Use of Components</h4>

<p>To speed development and ensure consistency of design, template
authors are encouraged to assemble pages from distinct component
templates that may be recycled in different contexts.  One typical
practice is to build a "master" template for an entire section of a
site, with a common header, footer and sidebar layout.  For each page
request, the "content" template is incorporated dynamically into a
specified area of the master template, usually a table cell.</p>

<p>(graphic)</p>

<p>Another common practice is to build small reusable templates that
may be included in other templates as logical components.  This may be
useful for common "widgets" such as search boxes or lists of related
links, as well as for building configurable portal pages where users
may assemble different types of content to their liking.</p>

<p>See <a href="tagref/include.html"><kbd>include</kbd></a> and <a
href="tagref/master.html"><kbd>master</kbd></a>.  See also <a
href="guide/components.html">Building reusable layout components</a>
and <a href="guide/master.html">Using master templates</a>.

</p>

<h4>Property Declarations</h4>

<p>Template authors need a simple mechanism for declaring properties
within the templates.  The most common use of such properties is for
configuring elements of an enclosing master template, such as the
title, navigation links, and whether to include a search box.  The
data dictionary specifies available properties as well as the set of
valid values when appropriate.</p>

<p>See <a href="tagref/property.html"><kbd>property</kbd></a>.</p>

<h4>Conditional Insertion</h4>

<p>Designers often need to tailor the layout depending on the specific
data being presented.  For example, when presenting a list of library
books that a user has checked out, the designer might want to
highlight the overdue ones in red.</p>

<p>See <a href="tagref/if.html"><kbd>if..else</kbd></a>.</p>

<h4>Iteration</h4>

<p>Dynamic pages often present lists of values or records, each of
which typically represents the results of a database query.  Template
authors must have a way to iterate over each value or record in such a
list and format it appropriately.  In the simplest scenario, the exact
HTML is repeated with each iteration.  However, template authors often
need to vary the design depending on the context.  For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>First and last items may be formatted differently from items
         in between.</p>
  <li><p>Special breaks may be required when a particular value changes.
      For example, a query may return the name and office of all
      employees in a company, and the designer may wish to insert
      a subheading for each office.</p>
  <li><p>Colors or patterns may alternate between items.  For example,
      the designer may want to have alternate between white and gray bands
      in a table.</p>
</ol>

<p>To accommodate these type of scenarios, the template parser sets
some additional variables that the designer can reference to vary
the layout from item to item.</p>

<p>See <a href="tagref/multiple.html"><kbd>multiple</kbd></a>,
       <a href="tagref/group.html"><kbd>group</kbd></a>,
       <a href="tagref/grid.html"><kbd>grid</kbd></a>.</p>
       <a href="tagref/list.html"><!-- invisible<kbd>list</kbd>.--></a></p>
</include>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <ul>

<li><p>Template tags are processed by the server each time a page is
requested.  The end result of this processing is a standard HTML page
that is delivered to the user.  Users do not see template tags in the
HTML source code of the delivered page.</p>

<li><p>With normal usage, the use of dynamic tags tends to increase
the amount of whitespace in the final HTML as compared to the
template.  This usually does not affect how browsers display the page.
However, if a page layout depends on the presence or absence of
whitespace between HTML tags for proper display, then special
care must be taken with dynamic tags to avoid adding whitespace.  </p>

<p>When placed on a line by themselves, tags that are containers for
template sections (<kbd>grid</kbd>, <kbd>if</kbd>, and <kbd>multiple</kbd>)
will cause newlines to be added to the page at the beginning and end
of the section.  This can be avoided by crowding the start and end
tags like so:

<pre>
&lt;td>&lt;if %x% eq 5>&lt;img src="five.gif">&lt;/if>
&lt;else>&lt;img src="notfive.gif">&lt;/else>&lt;/td>
</pre>

<p>Note that this should not be done unless necessary, since it
reduces the legibility of the template to others who need to edit the
template later.</p>

      <li><p>
	  <strong>Caution:</strong> &nbsp;
	  Do not write to the connection.  Specifically, if you must use the
	  <code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> tag, do not call <code>ns_puts</code>,
	  because it will not work the same way as in AOLserver's ADP
	  pages.
	</p>
