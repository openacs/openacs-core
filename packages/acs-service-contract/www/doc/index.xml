<section>
<title>Why</title>
<para>

To facilitate greater code reuse, application integration, 
    and package extensibility within the OpenACS.</para>

<para>

To do this acs-service-contract defines an API for the creation
    of interfaces and discovery of interface implementations.</para>


</section>

<section>
<title>Background</title>
<para>

Most component systems are based on the use of interfaces. Interfaces
    allow components to create contracts which define their functional
    level of reuse and customization. It also provides the infrastructure
    for runtime discovery of which implemented interfaces are available.</para>

<para>

The ACS4 is based on a thin object system, that is primarily relational
    but the acs_objects system allows a veneer of object orientedness
    by providing globally unique object ids, object metadata, and bundling
    of data and methods as an object. While this permits a level of
    reuse on an object or package basis, it requires hardcoding the unit 
    of reuse.</para>

<para>

ACS Service contract allows these objects and packages to also 
    define and register their implementation of interfaces, so the level
    of reuse is defined at the contract level. </para>

<para>

In addition ACS Service contract provides mean to dispatch method
    calls on an interface implementation. The dispatch means
    is only available through tcl. </para>

<para>

Interface Discovery is available programmatically as well as via
    documentation through ad_proc.</para>

<para>

The Service Contract interface specification was inspired by
    WDSL, the interface specification for web services.</para>

operation - a method of an interface. defines a method signature,

<title>Usage</title>

<section>
<title>Design the Contract</title>
<para>

First Off design the interface for your contract, keeping in mind
     that all implementations need to implement it and that extension of
     the contract after deployment is often not practical. In other words
     take the time to do a little future proofing and thinking about 
     possible uses that you weren't planning on.</para>

<section>
<title>FAQ</title>

<section>
<title>Why Does an implementation reference an interface?</title>
<para>

This might seem a little strange since a binding is the official
     reference between an implementation and an interface. However
     it is quite possible that an implementation for interface might
     exist prior to the interface being defined, ie the interface
     defining package is not installed. By retaining this information
     the interface defining package can be installed and the implementations
     already installed on the system can be bound to it.</para>
