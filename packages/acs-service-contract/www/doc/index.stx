ACS Service Contract Documentation

  Why

    To facilitate greater code reuse, application integration, 
    and package extensibility within the OpenACS.

    To do this acs-service-contract defines an api for the creation
    of interfaces and discovery of interface implementations.

  Background

    Most component systems are based on the use of interfaces. Interfaces
    allow components to create contracts which define their functional
    level of reuse and customization. It also provides the infrastructure
    for runtime discovery of which implemented interfaces are available.
      
    The ACS4 is based on a thin object system, that is primarily relational
    but the acs_objects system allows a veneer of object orientedness
    by providing globally unique object ids, object metadata, and bundling
    of data and methods as an object. While this permits a level of
    reuse on an object or package basis, it requires hardcoding the unit 
    of reuse.

    ACS Service contract allows these objects and packages to also 
    define and register their implementation of interfaces, so the level
    of reuse is defined at the contract level. 
   
    In addition ACS Service contract provides mean to dispatch method
    calls on an interface implementation. The dispatch means
    is only available through tcl. 

    Interface Discovery is available programmatically as well as via
    documentation through ad_proc.

    The Service Contract interface specification was inspired by
    WDSL, the interface specfication for web services.

  Hitchiker's Guide to Service Contract Definitions

    - contract - analogous to interface, contracts serve as logical 
		  containers for operations.

    - operation - a method of an interface. defines a method signature,
		  including both input and outputs as well as metadata
		  such as caching.
 	         
    - implementation - an implementation is a set of concrete functions
       		  that fufills an interface.
  
    - implementation alias - is the method of an implementation that
	 	  fufills a given operation of the contract.

    - bindings - association between an interface and an implementation.

    - types - define the kind of input and outputs a operation receives.

  Usage

    Design the Contract

       First Off design the interface for your contract, keeping in mind
     that all implementations need to implement it and that extension of
     the contract after deployment is often not practical. In other words
     take the time to do a little future proofing and thinking about 
     possible uses that you weren't planning on.

    Defining Operations

       Next define the logical operations that will make up your contract
     
    Register the Contract

       with acs contracts.

    Implement the Contract

  FAQ

     Why Does an implementation reference an interface?

       This might seem a little strange since a binding is the official
     reference between an implementation and an interface. However
     it is quite possible that an implementation for interface might
     exist prior to the interface being defined, ie the interface
     defining package is not installed. By retaining this information
     the interface defining package can be installed and the implementations
     already installed on the system can be bound to it.

     Creating Message Types

	- (sql)::
		 acs_sc_msg_type__new (name, spec):

	   defines a type based on spec. Spec should
	   be a string (possibly emtpy) that defines the
	   names and types that compose this type.
	   example 'ObjectDisplay.Name.InputType' as name
           'object_id:integer' as spec.

     Creating Interfaces 

	- (sql)::

		 acs_sc_contract__new (contract_name, contract_desc):

	   creates a new contract to serve as a logical 
 	   container for operations. contract_desc is a text
	   description of the contract.

	- (sql)::

		 acs_sc_operation__new (contract_name, operation_name,
				       operation_desc, operation_iscachable_p,
				       operation_inputtype, operation_outputtype
				      ):

	   creates a new operation as part of a contract.

     Creating Implementations

	- (tcl) acs_sc_proc (contract, operation, impl):
		registers an implementations. ?? why operation

     Discovery

	- (tcl) acs_sc_binding_exists_p (contract, impl): 
		returns boolean whether a binding exists between
		a given contract name and implmentation.

     Dispatching    

	- (tcl) acs_sc::invoke (contract, operation, [arguments, impl]):
		calls an operation

  Examples

    Included in the service contract package are examples for oracle
    and postgresql of a trivial contract.
  
    Also the search contract functions as a non-trivial core contract
    used by openacs4.
