  <h2>Converting Binary Documents to HTML</h2>
  <strong><a href="../index.html">Content Repository</a> : Developer Guide</strong>
<hr>

<p>The content repository uses the INSO libraries included with
Intermedia to support conversion of binary files such as Microsoft
Word documents to HTML.  This document describes how to make this
conversion be part of the item creation or editing process, such that
the content is always stored in the repository as HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because temporary tables and LOB storage are used
during the conversion process, the entire process described here must
be performed within the context of a single transaction.</p>

<h3>Create the Revision</h3>

<p>The first step is to create the revision that will be associated
with the converted document, and obtain the corresponding ID.  The
<kbd>content</kbd> column for the revision must be initialized with an
empty blob object:</p>

<pre>
revision_id := content_revision.new(item_id => :item_id,
                                    revision_id => :revision_id,
                                    data => empty_blob(),
                                    title => 'My Word Document',
                                    ...);
</pre>

<h3>Uploading Binary Files</h3>

<p>The next step in the process is to upload the binary file into the
temporary table <kbd>cr_doc_filter</kbd>.  This may be done using any
standard technique for uploading a binary file, such as an image.  The
temporary table has only two columns; one is a BLOB to store the document
itself, and one is the revision ID.</p>

<h3>Converting the Document</h3>

<p>Once the revision has been created and the file has been uploaded, the
file may be converted to HTML and written into the empty blob associated
with the revision.  This is done with the <kbd>to_html</kbd> procedure in
the <kbd>content_revision</kbd> package:</p>

<pre>
begin
  content_revision.to_html(:revision_id);
end;
/
</pre>

<p>Once the transaction is committed, the uploaded document is
automatically deleted from the <kbd>cr_doc_filter</kbd> table.</p>
