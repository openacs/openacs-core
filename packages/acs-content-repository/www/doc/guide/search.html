<hr>

<p>The content repository provides a consistent sitewide interface for
searching content.  It uses Intermedia to index the <tt>content</tt>
column of <tt>cr_revisions</tt>) as well as all the attribute columns
for each content type.</p>

<h3>Searching Content</h3>

<p>The <tt>content</tt> column in <tt>cr_revisions</tt> may contain
data in any text or binary format.  To accomodate searches across
multiple file types, the content repository uses an Intermedia index
with the INSO filtering option.  The INSO filter automatically detects
the the file type of a binary object, and extracts text from it for
indexing.  Most common file types are supported, including PDF and
Microsoft Word, and Excel and PowerPoint.</p>

<p>Searching for content requires the same syntax as any text index:</p>

<pre>
select
  score(1), revision_id, item_id
from
  cr_revisions r
where
  contains(content, 'company', 1) > 0
</pre>

<p>The above query may be useful for an administrative interface where
you wish to search across all revisions, but in most cases you only
want to search live revisions:</p>

<pre>
select
  score(1), revision_id, item_id, content_item.get_path(item_id) url, title
from
  cr_revisions
where
  contains(content, 'company', 1) > 0
and
  revision_id = content_item.get_live_revision(item_id)
</pre>

<p>The URL and title may be used to construct a hyperlink directly to
the item.</p>

<p>You may implement any number of variants on this basic
query to place additional constraints on the results, such as
publication date, content type, subject heading or a particular
attribute (see below).</p>

<p>Some limitations of the current implementation include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multilingual searches are not enabled by default.  You may
      enable them for one more languages by setting the appropriate
      Intermedia preferences when creating <tt>cr_rev_content_index</tt>.

  <li>Some items are not appropriate to display "stand-alone", but
      rather need to appear only in the context of a container
      document (typically their parent in the content repository).
      This is probably a limitation of <tt>content_item.get_path</tt>:
      it should be possible to specify an arbitrary function to return
      the path for items of a particular content type, with
      <tt>content_item.get_path</tt> as the default.
</ul>

<h3>Searching Attributes</h3>

<p>This task is primarily handled to two Intermedia indices:</p>

<p>Providing a generic mechanism for searching attributes is
complicated by the fact that the attributes for each content type are
different.  The content repository takes advantage of the XML features
in Oracle 8.1.6 to address this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After creating a new revision and inserting attributes into the
storage table for the content type and all its ancestors, you must
execute the <tt>content_revision.index_attributes</tt> procedure.
(Note that this cannot be called automatically by
<tt>content_revision.new</tt>, since the attributes in all extended
storage tables must be inserted first).

<li><p>This procedure creates a row in the
<tt>cr_revision_attributes</tt> table, and writes an XML document
including all attributes into this row.  A Java stored procedure using
the Oracle XML Parser for Java v2 is used to actually generate the XML
document.
<li><p>A special Intermedia index configured to parse XML documents
is built on the column containing the XML documents for all revisions.</p>
</ol>

<p>The Intermedia index allows you to use the WITHIN operator to search on
individual attributes if desired.</p>

<pre>
select 
  revision_id,score(1) 
from 
  cr_revisions 
where 
  contains(attributes, 'company WITHIN title', 1) > 0
</pre>

<p>Some limitations of the current implementation include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <tt>USER_DATASTORE</tt> associated with each row of the 
      <tt>cr_items</tt> table, which feeds Intermedia the contents
      of the <tt>content</tt> column (a BLOB) for the <em>live</em>
      revision of an item.  This should theoretically be more efficient
      for searching live content, especially in production environments
      where content is revised often.

  <li>A second <tt>USER_DATASTORE</tt> associated with each row of the
      <tt>cr_items</tt> table, which feeds Intermedia the XML
      document representing all attributes for the <em>live</em>
      revision of an item (from <tt>cr_revision_attributes</tt>).  

  <li>The default XML document handler for the content repository
      simply provides a flat file of all attributes.  Content types
      should also be able implement custom handlers, to allow the XML
      document to reflect one-to-many relationships or special
      formatting of attributes as well.  The handler should specify
      a java class and method, which a dispatch method can call by
      reflection.
</ol>
