  <h2>Organizing Content Items</h2>
  <strong><a href="/doc">ACS Documentation</a> :
     <a href="../index.html">Content Repository</a> : Developer Guide</strong>
<hr>

<p>The content repository organizes content items in a hierarchical
structure similar to a file system.  You manage content items in the
repository using the same basic operations as in a file system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A freshly installed content repository consists of a single "root"
      folder (analogous to the root directory <kbd>/</kbd> in UNIX or an
      empty partition in Windows or MacOS).

  <li>You organize items by creating subfolders under the root.

  <li>You can move or copy items from one folder to another.

  <li>You can create "links" or "shortcuts" for items to make them
      accessible from within other directories.

  <li>Each item has a "file name" and an absolute "path" that is
      determined by its location on a particular branch of the
      repository tree.  For example, the path to an item named
      <kbd>widget</kbd> in the folder <kbd>products</kbd> would be
      <kbd>/products/widget</kbd>.
</ul>

<p>The content repository adds an additional twist to a traditional
filesystem: <em>any</em> content item, not just a folder, may serve as
a container for any number of other content items.  For example,
imagine a book consisting of a preface, a number of chapters and a
bibliography (which in turn may have any number of entries).  The book
itself is a content item, in that it has attributes (publisher, ISBN
number, publication date, synopsis, etc.) associated with it.  It also
is the logical container for all its components.</p>

<p>It is important to note that folders are simply a special subtype
of content item.  The content repository's representation of a
parent-child relationship between a folder and the items it contains is
no different from the relationship between a book and its chapters.
Folders may be thought of simply as generic containers for grouping items
that are not necessarily part of a greater whole.</p>

<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>Consider a simple repository structure with the following
contents:</p>

<img src="organization.gif" height=360 width=440 border="1">

<p>Note the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The root folder of the content repository has a special ID which is
      returned by the function <kbd>content_item.get_root_folder</kbd>.

  <li>Regular content items such as <kbd>index</kbd> and <kbd>about</kbd>
      may be stored directly under the root folder.

  <li>The "About Us" page has a photo as a child item.  Note that the
      path to the photo is <kbd>/about/photo</kbd>.  Internally, the
      photo's <kbd>parent_id</kbd> (in the <kbd>cr_items</kbd> table) is set to
      the <kbd>item_id</kbd> of the "About Us" page.

  <li>The "Press" folder contains two items.  Internally, the 
      <kbd>parent_id</kbd> of the "Press Index" and "Release One" items
      are set to the <kbd>item_id</kbd> of the "Press" folder.
</ul>

<p>Note that the same effective organization could have been achieved
by creating the "Press Index" item under the root, and having press
releases as its children.  Using the folder approach may have the
following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content management systems can take advantage of the folder structure
      to implement an intuitive user interface analogous to familiar desktop
      tools (Windows Explorer, MacOS Finder, etc.).

  <li>You can use the content repository API to constraint the type of
      content that a folder may contain (except for the index page).
      For example, it is possible to limit the contents of the "Press"
      folder to items of type "Press Release."  See the <a
      href="../api/folder.html">Content Folder</a> API for more
      details.</p>
</ul>

    <h3>Using your own root</h3> 

    <p> By default, the content repository has one root folder for content
      items and one for templates. In some situations, that is not
      enough. For example, a package that can be instantiated several times
      might wish to store the content for each instance in its own content
      root. Creating your own content (and template) root also has the
      advantage that you will not accidentally access another package's
      content nor will another package access your content. Not that that
      could do any harm, because you have secured all your content through
      appropriate permissions.
    </p>
    
    <p> We only talk about creating content roots from here on &mdash;
      creating template roots is completely analogous. You create your own
      content root by calling <kbd>content_folder.new</kbd> in PL/SQL:
    </p>
    <pre>
declare
  v_my_content_root integer;
begin
  v_my_content_root := content_folder.new(
     name => 'my_root', 
     label => 'My Root', 
     parent_id => 0
  );
  -- Store v_my_content_root in a safe place
end;
/ </pre>
    <p> The important point is that you have to pass in <kbd>0</kbd> for the
      <kbd>parent_id</kbd>. This <kbd>parent_id</kbd> is special in that it
      indicates folders with no parent.</p>
    
    <p> The content repository does not keep track of who created what root
      folders. You have to do that yourself. In the above example, you need
      to store the value <kbd>v_my_content_root</kbd> somewhere, for example
      a table that is specific for your package, otherwise you won't have a
      reliable way of accessing your new content root.
    </p>
    <p> With multiple content roots, there can be many items with
      <kbd>item_path</kbd> <kbd>'/news/article'</kbd> and you need to tell the
      content repository which root you are talking about. For example, to
      retrieve content through <kbd>content_item.get_id</kbd>, you pass the
      id of your content root as the <kbd>root_folder_id</kbd> parameter to
      specify the content root under which the <kbd>item_path</kbd> should be
      resolved.
