  <h2>Publishing Content</h2>
  <strong><a href="../index.html">Content Repository</a> : Developer Guide</strong>
<hr>

<p>The content repository does not place any restrictions on the
methods employed for delivering content via a public server
infrastructure.  Applications are free to query the repository and
process the data in any way desired.</p>

<p>Although there are no restrictions on publishing methodology, the
repository API is intended to facilitate generic template-based
publication, regardless of the specific presentation layer used.  The
following diagram illustrates the steps typically involved in such a
publication process:</p>

<p>In general, there is an initial <em>resolution</em> step in which
the server must identify the appropriate content item and then decide
which template to actually parse.  Following that is an
<em>execution</em> step, during which setup tasks associated with the
template are performed.  Finally, the <em>merging</em> step combines
the data and layout into a rendered page.</p>

    <h3>Matching URLs to Content Items</h3>
    <p>The primary mechanism for matching URLs to Content Items are
      <em>virtual URL handlers</em>, <kbd>.vuh</kbd> files. An
      explanation of virtual URL handlers can be found in the tutorial on
      the <a href="/doc/request-processor.html">Request Processor</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p> Here is an example <kbd>index.vuh</kbd> file that you can adapt to
      your own purposes:
    </p>
    <pre>
# Get the paths

set the_url [ad_conn path_info]
set the_root $::acs::pageroot

# Get the IDs
set content_root \
  [db_string content_root {select content_item.get_root_folder from dual}]
set template_root \
  [db_string template_root {select content_template.get_root_folder from dual}]

# Serve the page
# DRB: Note that content::init modifies the local variable the_root, which is treated
# as though it's been passed by reference.   This requires that the redirect treat the
# path as an absolute path within the filesystem.
if { [content::init the_url the_root $content_root $template_root] } {
  set file "$the_root/$the_url"
  rp_internal_redirect -absolute_path $file
} else {
  ns_returnnotfound
}
</pre>
    <p> The <kbd>content_root</kbd> and <kbd>template_root</kbd> parameters
      select the content and template root folders. In the example, they
      are just the default roots that the content repository initializes on
      installation. If you want to store your content completely
      independent from that of other packages, you can initialize your own
      content root and pass that folder's ID on to <kbd>content::init</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p> To publish content through URLs that are underneath
      <kbd>/mycontent</kbd> you need to do the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Create a directory <kbd>mycontent</kbd> in your server's page root
	and an <kbd>index.vuh</kbd> file in that directory.
      </li>
      <li> Adapt the <kbd>set content_root ...</kbd> and <kbd>set
	  template_root ..</kbd> statements in the example above so that
	they are being set to the content and template root folders that
	  you want to publish content from.
      </li>
      <li> Change the <kbd>set the_url ...</kbd> statement so that the
	variable <kbd>the_url</kbd> contains the absolute path to the content
	item you wish to serve from your (or the default) content root.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> If you use the example <kbd>index.vuh</kbd> file above unaltered for
      requests to <kbd>my_content</kbd>, a request for
      <kbd>http://yourserver/mycontent/news/articles/42</kbd> would request
      the content item <kbd>/news/articles/42</kbd> from the content
      repository on the default content root folder.      
    </p>

<h3>Matching Content Items to Templates</h3>

<h3>Querying Content</h3>

<h3>Querying Attributes</h3>

<p>When you create a new content type or add an attribute to an
existing content type, a view is created (or recreated) that joins the
attribute tables for the entire chain of inheritance for that content
type.  The view always has the same name as the attribute table for
the content table, with an "x" appended to distinguish it from the
table itself (for example, if the attribute table for <strong>Press
Releases</strong> is <kbd>press_releases</kbd>, then the view will be named
<kbd>press_releasesx</kbd>.  Querying this view is a convenient means of
accessing any attribute associated with a content item.
</p>
<p>
As a shortcut, the item's template may call <kbd>content::get_content</kbd> 
in its Tcl file in order to automatically retrieve the current item's 
attributes. The attributes will be placed in a onerow datasource called 
<kbd>content</kbd> . The template may then call 
<kbd>template::util::array_to_vars content</kbd> in order to convert
the onerow datasource to local variables.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the "x" view, the Content Repository creates an "i"
view, which simplifies the creation of new revisions. The "i" view
has the same name as the content table, with "i" appended at the 
end. You may insert into the view as if it was a normal table; the
insert trigger on the view takes care of inserting the actual values
into the content tables. 
</p>

<h3>Querying Additional Data</h3>

<p>Templates often display more than simple content attributes.
Additional queries may be necessary to obtain data about related
objects not described directly in attribute tables.  The setup code
associated with a template typically performs these queries after
the initial query for any needed attributes.</p>

<h3>Merging Data with Templates</h3>    

<h3>Returning Output</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Write to the file system
  <li>Service public requests directly
</ol>
