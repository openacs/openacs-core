  <h2>Uninstalling the Content Repository</h2>
  <strong><a href="index.html">Content Repository</a></strong>
<hr>

<p>The content repository includes an uninstall script,
<kbd>sql/content-drop.sql</kbd>.  This script does two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drops the attribute storage tables for all content types you have
      defined.
  <li>Drops the general tables for the content repository.
</ol>

<p>The uninstall script does <strong>not</strong> do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It does <strong>not</strong> delete rows from the <kbd>acs_objects</kbd>
      table.  Many other tables reference the <kbd>object_id</kbd>
      column in this table, so there is the possibility that the
      uninstall script will encounter foreign key reference errors.

  <li>It does <strong>not</strong> delete types from the
      <kbd>acs_object_types</kbd> table.  As for objects themselves, it
      is impossible for an automatic script to properly handle
      disposal of all foreign key references.
</ol>

<p>Because of what the uninstall script does <strong>not</strong> do, it is only
appropriate for removing the content repository <em>in preparation for
removing the entire ACS Objects data model</em>.  If you wish to
upgrade an existing installation and cannot afford to lose your data,
you must run an upgrade script rather than uninstalling the entire
data model.</p>
