  <h2>Uninstalling the Content Repository</h2>
  <b><a href="index.html">Content Repository</a></b>
<hr>

<p>The content repository includes an uninstall script,
<tt>sql/content-drop.sql</tt>.  This script does two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drops the attribute storage tables for all content types you have
      defined.
  <li>Drops the general tables for the content repository.
</ol>

<p>The uninstall script does <b>not</b> do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It does <b>not</b> delete rows from the <tt>acs_objects</tt>
      table.  Many other tables reference the <tt>object_id</tt>
      column in this table, so there is the possibility that the
      uninstall script will encounter foreign key reference errors.

  <li>It does <b>not</b> delete types from the
      <tt>acs_object_types</tt> table.  As for objects themselves, it
      is impossible for an automatic script to properly handle
      disposal of all foreign key references.
</ol>

<p>Because of what the uninstall script does <b>not</b> do, it is only
appropriate for removing the content repository <em>in preparation for
removing the entire ACS Objects data model</em>.  If you wish to
upgrade an existing installation and cannot afford to lose your data,
you must run an upgrade script rather than uninstalling the entire
data model.</p>
