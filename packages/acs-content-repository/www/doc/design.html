<h3>I. Essentials</h3>

</ul>

<h3>II. Introduction</h3>

<p>Serving <em>content</em> is a basic function of any web site.
Common types of content include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Journal articles and stories
  <li>Documentation
  <li>News reports
  <li>Product reviews
  <li>Press releases
  <li>Message board postings
  <li>Photographs
</ul>

<p>Note that the definition of content is not limited to what is
produced by the publisher.  User-contributed content such as reviews,
comments, or message board postings may come to dominate active
community sites.</p>

<p>Regardless of its type or origin, it is often useful for
developers, publishers and users to handle all content in a consistent
fashion.  Developers benefit because they can base all their
content-driven applications on a single core API, thereby reducing the
need for custom (and often redundant) development.  Publishers benefit
because they can subject all types of content to the same management
and production practices, including access control, workflow,
categorization and syndication.  Users benefit because they can enjoy
a single interface for searching, browsing and managing their own
contributions.</p>

<p>The content repository itself is intended <em>only</em> as a common
substrate for developing content-driven applications.  It provides the
developer with a core set of content-related services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Defining arbitrary content types.
  <li>Common storage of content items (each item consists of a 
      text or binary data with additional attributes as specified by the
      content type).
  <li>Establishing relationships among items of any type.
  <li>Versioning
  <li>Consistent interaction with other services included in the ACS core,
      including permissions, workflow and object relationships.
  <li>Categorization
  <li>Searching
</ul>

<p>As a substrate layer, the content repository is not intended to
ever have its own administrative or user interface.  ACS modules and
custom applications built on the repository remain responsible for
implementing an appropriate interface.  (Note that the ACS Content
Management System provides a general interface for interacting with
the content repository).</p>

<h3>III.  Historical Considerations</h3>

<p>The content repository was originally developed in the Spring of
2000 as a standalone data model.  It was based on an earlier custom
system developed for an ArsDigita client.  Many of the principle
design features of the original data model were also reflected in the
ACS Objects system implemented in the ACS 4.0 core.  The content
repository was subsequently rewritten as an extension of ACS
Objects.</p>

<h3>V.  Design Tradeoffs</h3>

<p>The content repository is a direct extension of the core ACS Object
Model.  As such the same design tradeoffs apply.</p>

<p>The content repository stores all revisions of all content items in
a single table, rather than maintaining separate tables for "live" and
other revisions.  The single-table approach dramatically simplifies
most operations on the repository, including adding revisions, marking
a "live" revision, and maintaining a full version history.  The
drawback of this approach is that accessing live content is less
efficient.  Given the ID of a content item, it is not possible to
directly access the live content associated with that item.  Instead,
an extra join to the revisions table is required.  Depending on the
production habits of the publisher, the amount of live content in the
repository may be eclipsed by large numbers of infrequently accessed
working drafts.  The impact of this arrangement is minimized by
storing the actual content data in a separate tablespace (preferably
on a separate disk) from the actual revisions table, reducing its size
and allows the database server to scan and read it more
efficiently.</p>

<h3>VI.  Further Reading</h3>

<p>The <a href="object-model.html">Object Model</a> provides a graphic
overview of the the how the content repository is designed.  The model
links to pages of the API Guide that describe individual objects.  The
Developer Guide describes how to address common development tasks
using the content repository.</p>
