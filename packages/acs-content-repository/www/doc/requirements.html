<h3>VI.A Requirements: Data Model</h3>

<p><a name=item><b>5.0 MIME Types</b></a></p>

<p>The content repository must be able to store objects in any format,
both text and binary.  MIME types provide a standard set of codes for
identifying the file format of each content item.  For the purpose of
data integrity, the repository must have a canonical list of MIME types
that may be assigned to content items.</p>

<p><a name=type><b>10.0 Content Types</b></a></p>

<p>A <em>content type</em> is characterized by a set of attributes
that may be associated with a text or binary content object.
Attributes are stored separately from their associated content object,
and as such may be indexed, searched, sorted and retrieved
independently.  For example, attributes of a press release may include
a title, byline, and publication date.</p>

<p>The data model must support storage of descriptive information
for each content type:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>10.10</b> Content types must be associated with unique keyword
identifiers, such as <tt>press_release</tt>, so they can be referenced
in data tables, queries and procedural code.</p>

<p><b>10.20</b> Content types must be associated with singular and
plural descriptive labels, such as <b>Press Release</b> and <b>Press 
Releases</b>, to simplify user recognition.</p>

<p><b>10.20</b> Content types may specify any number of <em>attributes</em>.
Attribute values are simple strings or numbers.</p>

<p><b>10.30</b> Content types may inherit attributes from any other
other content type.  For example, a regional press release may be a
subtype of the press release type.  Regional press releases have a
<tt>region</tt> attribute in addition to the characteristics of a
regular press release.</p>

<p><b>10.40</b> Part of the definition of a content type may include a
description of the parent-child relationships allowed for items of
this type.  For example, a <b>Press Release</b> may contain one or
more items of type <b>Image</b>, but it should not contain any items
of type <b>Internal Financial Status Report</b>.</p>

<p><b>10.60</b> A content type definition may include a list of
allowed file MIME types for items of this type.</p>

<p><b>10.70</b> A content type definition may include a list of
tokens to identify or flag relationships with other items.  For example,
the content type definition for a chapter of a reference manual may
include the tokens <b>next</b>, <b>previous</b> and <b>see_also</b>.
Each type of relationship may include a minimum and/or maximum number
of relationships of this type that are required for an item to be
published.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a name=item><b>20.0 Content Items</b></a></p>

<p>Items are the fundamental building blocks of the content
repository.  Each item represents a distinct text or binary content
object that is publishable to the web, such as an article, report,
message or photograph.  An item my also include any number of
attributes with more structured data, such as title, source, byline
and publication date.</p>

<p>Content items have the following persistent characteristics which
the data model must support:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>20.10</b> Content items must have a simple unique identifier so they
can be related to other objects in the system.

<p><b>20.20</b> Each content item consists of a set of attributes and a
single text or binary object.

<p><b>20.25</b> All content items are associated with a few basic attributes
to facilitate searching and development of browser interfaces to the
content repository:</p>

<UL>
  <LI>A title 
  <LI>A brief description or summary 
  <LI>An author or contributor 
  <LI>A publication or posting date 
  <LI>A <em>distinguished</em> URL at which an item may be accessed.
  <LI>A MIME type 
</ul>

</p>

<p><b>20.30</b> Each content item must be an instance of a particular
<a href=#type>content type</a>.  The content type defines the
attributes associated with the content item, in addition to the basic
ones described above.</p>

<p><b>20.40</b> A content item must have a unique, persistent URL
(Uniform Resource Locator) by which it is publicly accessible, such as
<tt>/press-releases/products/widget</tt>.  To facilitate moving of
items within the repository, the item itself should only be associated
with the "tail" of the url, such as <tt>widget</tt>.  The absolute URL
of the item is determined by its location within the repository (See
<a href="#organization">Content Organization</a>).</p>

<p><b>20.50</b> It must be possible to specify the language of each item.</p>

<p><b>20.60</b> It must be possible to maintain a revision history for
both the attributes and the text or binary object associated with a
content item.</p>

<p><b>20.70</b>. There must be a flexible mechanism for implementing
access control on individual items, based on granting of permissions
to groups or individual users.</p>

<p><b>20.80</b>. A content item may be associated with any number
of workflows.</p>

<p><b>20.90</b>. Content items may themselves be "containers" or
"parents" for other content items.  For example, an <b>Article</b> may
contain multiple <b>Sections</b>.</p>

<p><b>20.95</b> Each item may be associated with any number of
related objects.  The type and number of relationships must be
constrained by the content type of the item (See 10.70 above).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a name=revision><b>30.0 Content Revision</b></a></p>

<p>As mentioned above, each content item may be associated with any
number of revisions.  The data model for revisions must support the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>30.10</b>. A revision consists of the complete state of the item
as it existed at a certain point in time.  This includes the main text
or binary object associated with the item, as well as all
attributes.</p>

<p><b>30.20</b>. The data model must be extensible so that revisions
for all content types (with any number of attributes) may be
stored and retrieved efficiently.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a name=organization><b>40.0 Organization of the Repository</b></a></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>40.10</b>. The data model must support the hierarchical
organization of content items in a manner similar to a file
system.</p>

<p><b>40.20</b>. The URL of a content item should reflect its location
in the hierarchy.  For example, a press release with the URL
<tt>/press-releases/products/new-widget</tt> is located at the third
level down from the root of the hierarchy.</p>

<p><a name=folder><b>40.20.5 Content Folder</b></a>.</p>

<p>A <em>folder</em> is analogous to a folder or directory in a file
system.  It represents a level in the content item hierarchy.  In the
previous example, <tt>press-releases</tt> is a folder under the
repository root, and <tt>products</tt> is folder within that.  The
description of a folder may include the following information:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>40.20.5.10</b>. A URL-encoded name for building the path to
folders and individual items within the folder.</p>

<p><b>40.20.5.20</b>. A pointer to a content item that may serve as the
"index" for the folder (i.e. the item that is served when the URL of
the folder itself is accessed).</p>

<p><b>40.20.5.30</b>. A set of constraints on the number and type of
content items that may be stored in the folder.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>40.30</b>. It must be possible to create symbolic links or
shortcuts to content items, so they may be presented at more than one
URL or branch of the hierarchy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a name=folder><b>40.30.5 Content Symbolic Link</b>.</p>

<p>A <em>symbolic link</em> is analogous to a symlink, alias or
shortcut in a file system.  The description of a symbolic link must include
the following information:</p>

<p><b>40.30.5.10</b>. A URL-encoded name for the symbolic link.  As
for folders and items, this only represents the "tail" of the URL,
with the full URL being determined by the folder in which the link is
located.</p>

<p><b>40.30.5.20</b>. A pointer to a target item which the symbolic
link references..</p>

<p><b>40.30.5.30</b>. A title or label, which may be different from
the title or label of the target item.</p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a name=template><b>50.0 Content Template</b></a>.</p>

<p>The content repository should provide a means of storing and
managing the templates that are merged with content items to render
output in HTML or other formats.  Templates are assumed to be text
files containing static markup with embedded tags or code to
incorporate dynamic content in appropriate places.  The data model 
requirements for templates are a subset of those for content items.</p>

<p>Because they typically need to reference a specific attributes, a
template is typically specific to a particular content types and its
subtypes.  

<h3>VI.B Requirements: Stored Procedure API</h3>

<p><b>100.10 MIME Types</b></p>

<P>Since a MIME type is a required attribute of each content item, the
repository must be capable of managing a list of recognized MIME types
for ensuring appropriate delivery and storage of content.</P>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>100.10.10</b>. Register a MIME type 
  <p><b>100.10.20</b>. Set the description of a MIME type 
  <p><b>100.10.30</b>. Get the description of a MIME type 
  <p><b>100.10.40</b>. Determine whether a MIME type is text or binary 
  <p><b>100.10.50</b>. Get a list of registered MIME types 
  <p><b>100.10.60</b>. Unregister a MIME type
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that the role of MIME types in the content
repository is simply to describe the general file format of each
content item.  Neither the data model nor the API support the full
range of allowed parameters for the general MIME types such as
<tt>text/plain</tt>.</p>

<p id="100-20"><b>100.20 Locales</b></p>

<P>The repository must have access to a list of recognized locales for
the purpose of publishing content items in multiple languages and
character sets.</P>

<p>All content in the repository is stored in UTF-8 to facilitate 
searching and uniform handling of content.  Locales may be specified 
as user preferences to configure the user interface in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>language of content (when items are available in multiple languages).
<li>language of system messages (form labels, warnings, menu links, etc.).
<li>character set (text content converted from UTF-8 to the specified
character set).
<li>number, date and currency format.
<li>choice of layout, including templates, graphics and other resources.
</ul>

<p>Functional requirements for locales include:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><b>100.20.10</b>. Register a locale, including language,
  territory and character set.</p>

  <p><b>100.20.20</b>. Get the language of a specified locale.</p>

  <p><b>100.20.10</b>. Get the character set code of a specified
  locale using either Oracle or WETF/ISO/ANSI codes.</p>

  <p><b>100.20.30</b>. Get the number, date and currency format of a
  specified locale.</p>

  <p><b>100.20.40</b>. Convert a text content item to a specified
  locale (character set).</p>

  <p><b>100.20.50</b>. Get a list of registered locales.</p>

  <p><b>100.20.60</b>. Unregister a locale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>100.30 Content Types</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>100.30.10</b>. Create a content type, optionally specifying that
it inherits the attributes of another content type.  Multiple
inheritance is not supported.</p>

<p><b>100.30.20</b>. Get and set the singular and plural proper names
for a content type.</p>

<p><b>100.30.30</b>. Create an attribute for a content type.</p>

<p><b>100.30.40</b>. Register a content type as a container for another
content type, optionally specifying a minimum and maximum count of live
items.</p> 

<p><b>100.30.50</b>. Register a content type as a container for another
content type, optionally specifying a minimum and maximum count of live
items.</p> 

<p><b>100.30.60</b>. Register a set of tags or tokens for labeling
child items of an item of a particular content type.</p>

<p><b>100.30.70</b>. Register a <a href=#template>template</a> for use
with a content type, optionally specifying a use context ("intranet",
"extranet") which the template is appropriate to use.</p>

<p><b>100.30.80</b>. Register a particular type of workflow to
associate with items of this content type by default.</p>

<p><b>100.30.90</b>. Register a MIME type as valid for a content type.
For example, the <b>Image</b> content type may only allow GIF and JPEG
file formats.</p>

<p><b>100.30.95</b> Register a relationship with another type of object,
specifying a token or name for the relationship type as well as a minimum
and/or maximum number of relationships of this type that are required
for the item to be published.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>100.40 Content Items</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>100.40.10</b>. Create a new item, specifying a parent context or
the root of the repository by default.</p>

<p><b>100.40.15</b>. Rename an item.</p>

<p><b>100.40.17</b>. Copy an item to another location in the repository.</p>

<p><b>100.40.20</b>. Move an item to another location in the repository.</p>

<p><b>100.40.30</b>. Get the full path (ancestry of an item) up to the
root.</p>

<p><b>100.40.35</b>. Get the parent of an item.</p>

<p><b>100.40.40</b>. Determine whether an item may have a child of
a particular content type, based on the existing children of the item and
the constraints on the content type.</p>

<p><b>100.40.45</b>. Label a child item with a tag or token, based on
the set of tags registered for the content type of the container item. </p>

<p><b>100.40.50</b>. Get the children of an item. </p>

<p><b>100.40.55</b>. Get the children of an item by type or tag.</p>

<p><b>100.40.60</b>. Establish a generic relationship between any
object and a content item, optionally specifying a relationship type.</p>

<p><b>100.40.70</b>. Create a revision.</p>

<p><b>100.40.80</b>. Mark a particular revision of an item as "live". </p>

<p><b>100.40.83</b>. Specify a start and end time when an item should be available.</p>

<p><b>100.40.85</b>. Clear the live revision attribute of an item,
effectively removing it from public view.

<p><b>100.40.90</b>. Get a list of revisions for an item, including
modifying user, date modified and comments. 

<p><b>100.40.95</b>. Revert to an older revision (create a new revision based
on an older revision).

</blockquote>

<p><b>100.50 Content Folders</b></p>

<p>The repository should allow for hierarchical arrangement of content
items in a manner similar to a file system.  The API to meet this
general requirement focuses primarily on <a href=#folder>content
folders</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>100.50.10</b>. Create a <b>folder</b> for logical groups of
content items and other folders.  The folder name becomes part of the
distinguished URL of any items it contains.  Folders may be created at
the "root" or may be nested within other folders.</p>

<p><b>100.50.20</b>. Set a label and description for a folder.</p>

<p><b>100.50.30</b>. Get the label and description for a folder.</p>

<p><b>100.50.40</b>. Get a list of folders contained within a folder.</p>

<p><b>100.50.50</b>. Move a folder to another folder.</p>

<p><b>100.50.60</b>. Copy a folder to another folder.</p>

<p><b>100.50.70</b>. Create a <b>symbolic link</b> to a folder from
within another folder.  The contents of the folder should be
accessible via the symbolic link as well as the regular path.</p>

<p><b>100.50.80</b>. Tag all live item revisions within a folder with a
common version descriptor (i.e. 'Version 1.0' or 'August 1 release'),
for the purpose of versioning an entire branch of the site.  Folder
objects themselves are <b>not</b> eligible for versioning, since they
are solely containers and do not have any content other than the items
they contain.</p>

<p><b>100.50.90</b>. Delete a folder if it is empty.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Note that folders are simply a special type of content item, and as
such may receive the same object services as items, (namely access
control and workflow).  In addition to the file-system analogy
afforded by folders, any type of content item may serve as a contain
for other content items (see below).</p>

<H3>Workflow</H3>

<P>The repository must offer integration with a workflow package for managing 
the content production process.</P>

<p><b>100.60 Categorization</b></p>

<p>The repository must support a common hierarchical taxonomy of subject
classifications that may be applied to content items.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>100.60.10</b>. Create a new subject category.</p>

<p><b>100.60.20</b>. Create a new subject category as the child of
another subject category.</p>

<p><b>100.60.30</b>. Assign a subject category to a content item.</p>

<p><b>100.60.40</b>. Remove a subject category from an item.</p>

<p><b>100.60.50</b>. Get the subject categories assigned to a content
item.</p>

</blockquote>

<H3>Search</H3>

<p>The repository must have a standard means of indexing and searching all
content.</P>

<H3>Access Control</H3>

<p>The repository must have a means of restricting access on an item-by-item
basis.</p>

<h3>VI.C Requirements: Presentation Layer API</h3>

<p>The presentation layer must have access to a subset of the stored
procedure API in order to search and retrieve content directly from the
repository if desired.</p>
