      <para>Because the current test package uses in-memory variables instead of database objects to track its tests, it is incompatible with the standard category package.  It uses an internal, single-dimension category field.  Should this eventually get extended, a more complete list of categories to implement could be:</para>
<programlisting>Testing Mode
  Regression
  Smoke
  Stress
  Default-Only (for tests, such as front page UI tests, that will break 
                once the default site is modified and can be ignored on 
                non-default sites)
  production-safe
  security_risk
Layer
  Web Page
  Tcl Page Contract
  Tcl API
  SQL  
Severity (derives from ns_log values)
  Notice (use this for informational items that do not imply a problem)
  Warning (use this for submitted tests w/o fixes; hygiene tests such as deprecated function sweeps)
  Error (default severity)
  Test Validity Bug (use this for problems that suggest the test itself in invalid or broken)
Test Data
  Self-contained  Requires no test data, leaves no test data.
  Populate  Generates and leaves test data, for other tests or for end users.
Package Version
  5.0.0
  etc
