<a name=basic><h3>Basic Search</h3></a>
<p> To enter a query, just type in a few descriptive words 
and hit the 'enter' key (or click on the Search button) for a 
list of relevant pages.</p>
<p>Our search uses sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that 
are both important and relevant to your search. For instance, when our search 
analyzes a page, it assigns higher relevance to pages in which 
your query terms appear near each other. </p>


<a name=and><h3>Automatic "and" Queries</h3></a>
<p> By default, our search only returns pages that include all of your search 
terms. There is no need to include "and" between terms.
To restrict a search further, just include more terms. </p>


<a name=stopwords><h3>What is a stop word?</h3></a>
<p> Our search ignores common words and characters (known as stop words) as 
they tend to slow down searches without improving the quality of the 
results. Terms such as <em>"where"</em> and <em>"how"</em>, as well 
as certain single digits and single letters, are not included in searches.</p>


<a name="context"><h3>See your search terms in context</h3> </a> 
<p> Each search result contains at least one excerpt from the found 
web page, which shows how your search terms are used in context on that 
page. Your search terms are bolded so you can tell at a glance whether 
the result is a page you want to visit. </p>

<a name="stemming"><h3>Does our search use stemming?</h3> </a>
Our search allows one to find same words with different 
endings. For example, it will also try to find the word "test" if 
"testing" or "tests" is given in search query.

<a name=case><h3>Does capitalization matter?</h3></a> 
<p> The searches are <b>not</b> case sensitive. All letters, regardless 
of how you type them, will be understood as lowercase. For example, 
searches for "george washington", "George Washington", and "gEoRgE wAsHiNgToN" 
 will all return the same results.</p>
