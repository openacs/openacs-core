<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
<p>Software development is a big feedback loop: a developer writes
something, tests it, and then repeats until the results are
satisfactory. It&#39;s important to streamline this cycle by having
a development environment which makes it easy to analyze what the
software is doing under the hood.</p>
<h2>Peeking Under the Hood</h2>
<p>Our development environment previously consisted largely of
Emacs, and <tt>tail -f
/web/servername/log/servername-error.log</tt>. Now this has been
augmented: <tt>ad_footer</tt> and <tt>ad_admin_footer</tt> now
display a link entitled <em>Developer Information</em>. (You can
use the <tt>ds_link</tt> procedure to generate the link yourself.)
Following the link displays a screenful of information
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The times that the request started and ended, and its duration
(with millisecond accuracy).</li><li>The request parameters (method, url, query, headers,
etc.).</li><li>The output headers, if any.</li><li>Information about all database queries performed while loading
the page, including their respective durations (with millisecond
accuracy).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the ClientDebug facility of AOLserver 2 has been
re-implemented in the abstract URL system (which serves nearly all
non-static pages). If an error occurs while serving a page, a stack
trace is printed out.</p>
<p>Note that these nifty features pop up only when you are logged
in as a site-wide administrator! Revealing this information to
anyone else would pose a huge security risk.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>

Tired of using <tt>ns_log</tt>
 to instrument your code, then
grokking the error log to see what&#39;s wrong with your page? Use
the <tt>ds_comment</tt>
 routine instead:
<blockquote><pre>
ds_comment "Foo is $foo"
</pre></blockquote>

Your comment will show up at the bottom of the page, beneath the
<em>Developer Information</em>
 link (but only for site-wide
administrators). It will also be displayed on the Developer
Information page itself.
<p>Comments are displayed even if an error occurs in the page!</p>
<h3>Enabling It</h3>
<p>Load the packate acs-developer-support via package manager,
browse to /ds and enable the desired options.</p>
<p>Be careful of you enable developer support on busy production
systems - they probably incur a performance hit.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The security subsystem registers preauth and trace filters which
store relevant connection information in shared variables
(<tt>nsv</tt>s). The security subsystem also renames the AOLserver
<tt>ns_db</tt> procedure and registers a wrapper which aggregates
information about database queries.</p>
