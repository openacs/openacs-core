#
# The following test was deactivated by Gustaf Neumann, since it makes
# little sense and does more harm than good.
#
# Rationale:
#
#  a) never change the system encoding in a multi threaded Tcl code,
#     unless you are aware of all the consequences. So far, the system
#     encoding is a global variable in C. If this is changed from
#     e.g. one thread, it is changed at the same time for all threads
#     (maybe in the middle of a Tcl command). It also will effect
#     to communication with databases.
#
#  b) Since the nsproxy code is running as a different process, the
#     intention is not clear to me. If there is the goal to change the
#     encoding for a single file, why not change it for this file?
#
#  c) The use case for the test is unclear. if a program requries in a
#     single run different system encodings, it does something
#     probably wrong.

# aa_register_case \
#     -cats {api smoke} -procs {
#     proxy::exec
# } exec_binary_input {
#     When the encoding is iso8859-1, Tcl's exec does not do line
#     translation.  the exec wrapper should be sensitive to this.  Use a
#     temporary file to work around the fact that there is no way to
#     disable line translation on the result of [exec].
