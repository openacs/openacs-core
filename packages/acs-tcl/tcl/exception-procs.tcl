        Generic code for OpenACS to handle exceptions and traps based on
        Tcl's primitives. This implementation is a slight generalization
        of the Tcl 8.6 built-in ::try, which handles ad_script_aborts
        automatically.

        The command "ad_try" should replace the various exception handling
        constructs such as "catch", which tend to swallow often error
        conditions, making debugging unnecessarily hard.  It will make
        "with_finally" and "with_catch" obsolete, which should be marked
        as deprecated in the not-to-far future.
