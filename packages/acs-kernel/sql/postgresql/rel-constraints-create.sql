--
--           What segments must a party be in 
--           if the party were to be on side :rel_side of a relation of 
--           type :rel_type to group :group_id ?
--
-- Answer:   select required_rel_segment

--
-- Notes: we take special care not to get identity rows, where group_id and 
-- rel_type are equivalent to segment_id.  This can happen if there are some 
-- funky constraints in the system, such as membership to Arsdigita requires 
-- user_profile to Arsdigita. Then you could get rows from the 
-- rc_all_constraints view saying that:
--     user_profile to Arsdigita 
--     requires being in the segment of Arsdigita Users.
--
-- This happens because user_profile is a type of memebrship, and there's a 
-- constraint saying that membership to Arsdigita requires being in the
-- Arsdigita Users segment.  We eliminate such rows from the rc_all_constraints
-- view with the "not (...)" clause below.

-- View: rc_segment_dependency_levels
--
-- This view is designed to determine what order of segments is safe
-- to use when adding a party to multiple segments.
--
-- Question: Given a table or view called segments_I_want_to_be_in,
--           which segments can I add a party to first, without violating
--           any relational constraints?
--
-- Answer:   select segment_id
--           from segments_I_want_to_be_in s,
--                rc_segment_dependency_levels dl
--           where s.segment_id = dl.segment_id(+)
--           order by nvl(dl.dependency_level, 0)
--
-- Note: dependency_level = 1 is the minimum dependency level.
--       dependency_level = N means that you cannot add a party to the
--                          segment until you first add the party to some
--                          segment of dependency_level N-1 (this view doesn't
--                          tell you which segment -- you can get that info
--                          from rel_constraints table or other views.
--
-- Another Note: not all segments in rel_segments are returned by this view.
-- This view only returns segments S that have at least one rel_constraints row
-- where rel_segment = S.  Segments that have no constraints defined on them
-- can be said to have dependency_level=0, hence the outer join and nvl in the
-- example query above (see "Answer:").  I could have embedded that logic into
-- this view, but that would unnecessarily degrade performance.
--
-- create view rc_segment_dependency_levels as
--       select rel_segment as segment_id,
--              max(tree_level) as dependency_level
--       from (select rel_segment, level as tree_level
--             from rel_constraints
--             connect by required_rel_segment = prior rel_segment
--                 and prior rel_side = 'two')
--       group by rel_segment;

-- DCW 2001-04-19, this view is not a direct port rather it gives equivalent
-- information without the use of a tree query, which in this case would be
-- problematic, since we are actually dealing with a directed graph instead 
-- of a tree structure.  This view would also work for oracle.
