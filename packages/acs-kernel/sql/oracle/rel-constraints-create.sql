--           What segments must a party be in 
--           if the party were to be on side :rel_side of a relation of

--
-- Notes: we take special care not to get identity rows, where group_id and 
-- rel_type are equivalent to segment_id.  This can happen if there are some 
-- funky constraints in the system, such as membership to Arsdigita requires 
-- user_profile to Arsdigita. Then you could get rows from the 
-- rc_all_constraints view saying that:
--     user_profile to Arsdigita 
--     requires being in the segment of Arsdigita Users.
--
-- This happens because user_profile is a type of memebrship, and there's a 
-- constraint saying that membership to Arsdigita requires being in the
-- Arsdigita Users segment.  We eliminate such rows from the rc_all_constraints
-- view with the "not (...)" clause below.
