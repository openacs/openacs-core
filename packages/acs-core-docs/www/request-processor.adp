Request Processor; more details can be found in the <a class="xref" href="rp-design" title="Request Processor Design">OpenACS 4

behind the system, and implications and usage for the application
developer.</p>

<a name="rp-thenewway" id="rp-thenewway"></a>Request Processor</h3></div></div></div><p>The 5.7.0 Request Processor is a global filter and set of Tcl
procs that respond to every incoming URL reaching the server. The
following diagram summarizes the stages of the request processor
assuming a URL request like <code class="computeroutput">http://someserver.com/notes/somepage.adp</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/rp-flow.gif" align="middle"></div><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term">Stage 1: Search Site Map</span></dt><dd>
<p>The first thing the RP does is to map the given URL to the
appropriate physical directory in the filesystem, from which to
serve content. We do this by searching the site map data model
(touched on in the <a class="xref" href="packages" title="OpenACS Packages">Packages</a>, and further discussed in <a class="xref" href="subsites" title="Writing OpenACS Application Pages">Writing OpenACS Application
Pages</a>). This data model maps URLs to objects representing
content, and these objects are typically package instances.</p><p>After looking up the appropriate object, the RP stores the URL,
the ID of the object it found, and the package and package instance
the object belongs to into the environment of the connection. This
environment can be queried using the <code class="computeroutput">ad_conn</code> procedure, which is described in
detail in <a class="xref" href="rp-design" title="Request Processor Design">OpenACS 4 Request Processor Design</a>.
The <a class="link" href="subsites" title="Writing OpenACS Application Pages">page development</a> tutorial
shows you how to use this interface to make your pages aware of
which instance was requested.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="term">Stage 2: Authentication</span></dt><dd><p>Next, the Request Processor examines the request for session
information. Session information is generally sent from the client
(the user's browser) to the server via cookies. The <a class="link" href="security-notes" title="Security Notes">security/session
handler</a> is described in detail in its own document. It examines
the client request and either extracts or sets up new session
tokens for the user.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Stage 3: Authorization</span></dt><dd><p>Next, the Request Processor checks if the user has appropriate
access privileges to the requested part of the site. In OpenACS
5.7.0, access control is dictated by the <a class="ulink" href="permissions" target="_top">permissions system</a>. In this case,
the RP checks if the user has "read" priviledges on the object in
the site map specified by the URL. This object is typically a
package instance, but it could easily be something more granular,
such as whehter the user can view a particular piece of content
within a package instance. This automatic check makes it easy to
set up sites with areas that are only accessible to specific groups
of users.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Stage 4: URL Processing, File
Search</span></dt><dd>
<p>Finally, the Request Processor finds the file we intend to
serve, searching the filesystem to locate the actual file that
corresponds to an abstract URL. It searches for files with
predefined "magic" extensions, i.e. files that end with:
<code class="computeroutput">.html</code>, <code class="computeroutput">.tcl</code> and <code class="computeroutput">.adp</code>.</p><p>If the RP can't find any matching files with the expected
extensions, it will look for virtual-url-handler files, or
<code class="computeroutput">.vuh</code> files. A <code class="computeroutput">.vuh</code> file will be executed as if it were a
Tcl file, but with the tail end of the URL removed. This allows the
code in the <code class="computeroutput">.vuh</code> file to act
like a registered procedure for an entire subtree of the URL
namespace. Thus a <code class="computeroutput">.vuh</code> file can
be thought of as a replacement for filters and registered procs,
except that they integrate cleanly and correctly with the RP's URL
mapping mechanisms. The details of how to use these files are
described in <a class="xref" href="rp-design" title="Request Processor Design">OpenACS 4 Request Processor
Design</a>.</p><p>Once the appropriate file is found, it is either served directly
if it's static content, or sent to the template system or the
standard Tcl interpreter if it's a dynamic page.</p>

<a name="rp-basicapi" id="rp-basicapi"></a>Basic

Processor has populated the environment of the request with several
pieces of useful information. The RP's environment is accessible
through the <code class="computeroutput">ad_conn</code> interface,
and the following calls should be useful to you when developing
dynamic pages:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">

served.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="computeroutput">[ad_conn
