        All OpenACS code is available anonymously.  To get code
      anonymously, use the parameter
      <tt class="computeroutput">-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot</tt> immediately after <tt class="computeroutput">cvs</tt> in a cvs command to check out or export code.
      </p><p>
        If you are an OpenACS developer, you should check out code so
        that you or any other developer can commit it.  To do this, use
        the parameter
        <tt class="computeroutput">-d:ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot</tt>
        immediately after <tt class="computeroutput">cvs</tt> in
        checkout commands.  This will create a local checkout directory
        that uses cvs.openacs.org but does not specify the user.  By
        default, it will use your local account name as the user, so if
        you are logged in as &quot;foobar&quot; it will try to check out and
        commit as if you had specified
        <tt class="computeroutput">:ext:foobar@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot</tt>.  The advantage of not specifying a user in the checkout command is that other users can work in the directory using their own accounts.
      </p><p>
        OpenACS.org supports non-anonymous cvs access only over ssh, so you
        must have <tt class="computeroutput">CVS_RSH=ssh</tt> in your
        environment.  (Typically this is accomplished by putting
        <tt class="computeroutput">export CVS_RSH=ssh</tt> into
        <tt class="computeroutput">~/.bash_profile</tt>.).  If your local
        account name does not match your cvs.openacs.org account name, create a
        file <tt class="computeroutput">~/.ssh/config</tt> with an entry
        like:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">Host cvs.openacs.org
    User joel
</pre><p>
        With this setup, you will be asked for your password with
        each cvs command.  To avoid this, set up ssh certificate
        authentication for your openacs account.  (<a href="http://www.uberdose.com/kbase/ssh-automatic-login/" target="_top">More
        information</a>)
      </p><p>
        You may want to set some more default actions for CVS usage.
  To do so, create the file
        <tt class="computeroutput">~/.cvsrc</tt> with the contents:
      </p><pre class="screen"><span class="action"><span class="action">cvs -z6
cvs -q</span></span></pre><p><tt class="computeroutput">-z6</tt> speeds up cvs access over the network quite a bit by enabling compressed
        connection by default.  <tt class="computeroutput">-q</tt> suppresses some verbose output from commands.  For example, it makes the output of <tt class="computeroutput">cvs up</tt> much easier to read.</p><div class="sidebar"><p>Administrator Note: These are the steps to grant CVS commit rights to a user:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create the user's account.

      should work from the latest core release branch.  Currently this
      is oacs-5-5.  This ensures that you are working on top
      of a stable OpenACS core, but still allows you to commit feature
      changes to non-core packages.  To check out all packages,</p><pre class="screen"><span class="action"><span class="action">cvs -d :ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot co -r oacs-5-5 openacs-4</span></span></pre><p>If you work in the directories created with this command, all of your

            branch.  Your work will be merged back to HEAD for you
            with each release.</p><p>Because the entire openacs-4 directory is large, you may

      Core, work from the HEAD branch.  HEAD is used for active
              development of the next version of core OpenACS. It may be very
              buggy; it may not even install correctly. Do not use this branch for
              development of non-core features unless your work depends on some
              of the HEAD core work. To check out HEAD, omit the
              <tt class="computeroutput">-r</tt> tag.</p><p></p><p>To check out HEAD for development, which requires an OpenACS developer account:</p><pre class="screen"><span class="action"><span class="action">cvs -d:ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot checkout acs-core</span></span></pre><p>To check out HEAD anonymously:</p><pre class="screen"><span class="action"><span class="action">cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot checkout acs-core</span></span></pre></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id3042054"></a>Checkout .LRN</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        .LRN consists of a given version openacs core, plus a set of
        packages. These are collectively packages together to form a
        distrubution of .LRN. F .LRN 2.0.0 sits on top of OpenACS 5.0.0.
        .LRN also uses an OpenACS install.xml file during installation;
        this file is distributed within the dotlrn package and must be
        moved. To get a development checkout of .LRN in the subdirectory
        <tt class="literal">dotlrn</tt>:
      </p><pre class="screen"><span class="action"><span class="action">cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot checkout -r oacs-5-5 acs-core

      Once you have a checkout you can use some commands to track
      what has changed since you checked out your copy.  <tt class="computeroutput">cvs -n update</tt> does not change any files, but reports which changes have been updated or locally modified, or are not present in CVS.
    </p><p>To update your files, use <tt class="computeroutput">cvs update</tt>.  This will merge changes from the repository with your local files.  It has no effect on the cvs.openacs.org repository.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="openacs-cvs-concepts"></a>OpenACS CVS Concepts</h3></div></div><div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id3042149"></a>Modules</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        All OpenACS code resides within a single CVS module, <tt class="computeroutput">openacs-4</tt>.  (The openacs-4 directory contains code for all versions of OpenACS 4 and later, and .LRN 1 and later.)   Checking out this module retrieves all openacs code of any type.  For convenience, subsets of <tt class="computeroutput">openacs-4</tt> are repackaged as smaller modules.</p><p>
          <tt class="computeroutput">acs-core</tt> contains only critical common
          packages. It does not have any user applications, such as forums,
          bug-tracker, calendar, or ecommerce.  These can be added at
          any time.

        Tags and Branches
      </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        Tags and Branches look similar in commands, but behave differently. A tag is a fixed point on a branch.  Check out
            a tag to get a specific version of OpenACS. Check out a branch to
            get the most current code for that major-minor version (e.g., 5.0.x
            or 5.1.x). You can only commit to a branch, not a tag, so check out
            a branch if you will be working on the code. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><tt class="computeroutput">openacs-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">x</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">y</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">z</span></span>-final</tt>
            tags mark final releases of OpenACS.  This tag is applied to the acs-core files for an OpenACS core release, and to the latest released versions of all other packages at the time of release.  Example: <tt class="computeroutput">openacs-5-0-4-final</tt>.
                </p></li><li><p><tt class="computeroutput">dotlrn-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">x</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">y</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">z</span></span>-final</tt>
            tags mark final releases of .LRN.  These tags apply only to .LRN packages.  Example: <tt class="computeroutput">dotlrn-2-0-1-final</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><tt class="computeroutput"><span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">packagename</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">x</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">y</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">z</span></span>-final</tt>
                  tags apply to releases of individual packages.  For example, <tt class="computeroutput">calendar-2-0-0-final</tt> is a tag that will retrieve only the files in the calendar 2.0.0 release. It applies only to the
                  calendar package. All non-core, non-dotlrn packages should have a
                  tag of this style, based on the package name. Many packages have
                  not been re-released since the new naming convention was adopted
                  and so don't have a tag of this type.
                </p></li><li><p><tt class="computeroutput">openacs-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">x</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">y</span></span>-compat</tt> tags point to the most recent released version of OpenACS <span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">X</span></span>.<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">Y</span></span>.
            It is similar to openacs-x-y-z-compat, except that it will
            always get the most recent dot-release of Core and the
            most recent compatible, released version of all other
            packages.  All of the other tag styles should be static,
            but -compat tags may change over time. If you want version
            5.0.4 exactly, use the openacs-5-0-4-final tag. If you want the best newest released code in the 5.0.x release series and you want to upgrade within 5.0.x later, use the compat tag. 
            </p><p>
              For example, if you check out the entire tree with -r
              openacs-5-0-compat, you might get version 5.0.4 of each OpenACS
              core package, version 2.0.1 of calendar, version 2.0.3 of each .LRN
              package, etc. If you update the checkout two months later, you
              might get version 5.0.5 of all OpenACS core packages and version
              2.1 of calendar.
            </p></li><li><p>oacs-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">x</span></span>-<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">y</span></span> is a <span class="emphasis"><em>branch, </em></span>, not a tag.  All core packages in the 5.0 release series (5.0.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, etc) are also on the oacs-5-0 branch.  Similarly, OpenACS core packages for 5.1.0 are on the oacs-5-1 branch.</p><p>These branches are used for two purposes.  OpenACS
                Core packages on these branches are being tidied up for
            release.  Only bug fixes, not new features, should be
            added to core packages on release branches.  For all other
            packages, release branches are the recommended location
            for development.  For example, if you are working on
            calendar, which is compatible with openacs 5.0 but not
                5.1, work on the oacs-5-0 branch.</p></li><li><p><tt class="computeroutput">HEAD</tt> is a branch used

      Rules for Committing Code to the OpenACS repository
    </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      CVS commit procedures are governed by 
      <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=185506" target="_top">
        TIP (Technical Improvement Proposal) #61: Guidelines for CVS committers
      </a>
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          Which branch?
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              For core packages, new features should always be
              committed on HEAD, not to release branches.
            </p></li><li><p>
              For core packages, bug fixes should be committed on the
              current release branch whenever applicable.
            </p></li><li><p>
              For non-core packages, developers should work on a
              checkout of the release branch of the lastest release. For example,
              if OpenACS 5.1.0 is released, developers should work on the
              oacs-5-1 branch. When oacs-5-2 is branched, developers should
              continue working on oacs-5-1 until OpenACS 5.2.0 is actually
              released.
            </p><p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>
                Reason: First, this ensures that developers are working against stable core code. Second, it ensures that new package releases are available to OpenACS users immediately.</em></span></p></li><li><p>
              The current release branch is merged back to HEAD after
              each dot release.
            </p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
          New packages should be created in the 
          <tt class="computeroutput">
            /packages
          </tt>
          directory
          and the maturity flag in the .info file should be zero. This is a change from
          previous policy, where new packages went to /contrib/packages)
        </p></li><li><p>
          Code
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              Only GPL code and material should be committed to the
              OpenACS CVS repository (cvs.openacs.org)
            </p></li><li><p>Do not mix formatting changes with code changes.  Instead, make a formatting-only change which does not affect the logic, and say so in the commit comment.  Then, make the logic change in a separate commit.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Reason: This makes auditing and merging code much easier.</em></span>
            </p></li><li><p>
              Database upgrade scripts should only span one release
              increment, and should follow
              <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/current/eng-standards-versioning.html#naming-upgrade-scripts" target="_top">
                Naming Database Upgrade Scripts
              </a>
              .
            </p><p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Reason: If an upgrade script ends with the final release
              number, then if a problem is found in a release candidate it cannot
        be addressed with another upgrade script. E.g., the last planned
        upgrade script for a package previously in dev 1 would be
        upgrade-2.0.0d1-2.0.0b1.sql, not upgrade-2.0.0d1-2.0.0.sql. Note
        that using rc1 instead of b1 would be nice, because that's the
        convention with release codes in cvs, but the package manager
        doesn't support rc tags.</em></span>
      </p></li><li><p>
              Database upgrade scripts should never go to the release
              version, e.g., should always have a letter suffix such as d1 or
              b1.
            </p></li><li><p>
              CVS commit messages should be intelligible in the context
              of Changelogs. They should not refer to the files or
              versions.
            </p></li><li><p>
              CVS commit messages and code comments should refer to
              bug, tip, or patch number if appropriate, in the format &quot;resolves
              bug 11&quot;, &quot;resolves bugs 11, resolves bug 22&quot;. &quot;implements tip 42&quot;,
              &quot;implements tip 42, implements tip 50&quot;, &quot;applies patch 456 by User
              Name&quot;, &quot;applies patch 456 by User Name, applies patch 523 by
              ...&quot;.

        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              A TIP is a Techical Improvement Proposal (

              ).  A proposed change must be approved by TIP if:
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              It changes the core data model, or
            </p></li><li><p>
              It will change the behavior of any core package in a way
              that affects existing code (typically, by changing public API), or
            </p></li><li><p>
              It is a non-backwards-compatible change to any core or
              standard package.
            </p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
          A proposed change need not be TIPped if:
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              it adds a new function to a core package in a way that:
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                  does not change the backwards-compatibility of public API
                  functions.
                </p></li><li><p>
                  does not change the data model

              it changes private API, or
            </p></li><li><p>
              it is a change to a non-core, non-standard package
            </p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
          Tags
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              When a package is released in final form, the developer
              shall tag it &quot;packagename-x-y-z-final&quot; and &quot;openacs-x-y-compat&quot;. x-y
              should correspond to the current branch. If the package is
              compatible with several different core versions, several compat
              tags should be applied.
            </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Reason 1: The packagename tag is a permanent,
        static tag that allows for future comparison. The compat tag is a
        floating tag which is used by the repository generator to determine
        the most recent released version of each package for each core
        version. This allows package developers to publish their releases
        to all users of automatic upgrade without any intervention from the
        OpenACS release team.Reason 2: The compat tags allows CVS users to
        identify packages which have been released since the last core
        release.Reason 3: The compat tag or something similar is required
        to make Rule 6 possible.</em></span>
      </p></li><li><p>
              When OpenACS core is released, the openacs-x-y-z-final
              tag shall be applied to all compat packages.
            </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
        Reason: This allows OpenACS developers who are creating
        extensively customized sites to branch from a tag which is stable,
        corresponds to released code instead of development code, and
        applies to all packages. This tag can be used to fork packages as
        needed, and provides a common ancestor between the fork and the
        OpenACS code so that patches can be generated.
        </em></span>
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
          For example, adding a new API function wouldn't require a
          TIP. Changing an existing API function by adding an optional new
          flag which defaults to no-effect wouldn't require a TIP. Added a
          new mandatory flag to an existing function would require a
          TIP.

      Informal Guidelines
    </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      Informal guidelines which may be obsolete in places and should be reviewed:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          Before committing to cvs you must submit a bug report and
          patch to the 
          <a href="http://openacs.org/bugtracker/openacs" target="_top">
            OpenACS
            bug tracker
          </a>
          . The only exceptions to this rule are
          for 
          <a href="/projects/openacs/4.7/package_inventory" target="_top">
            package
            maintainers
          </a>
          committing in a package they are
          maintaining and for members of the core team.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If you are committing a bug fix you need to coordinate
          with the package maintainer. If you are a maintainer then
          coordinate with any fellow maintainers.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If you are to commit a new feature, an architecture
          change, or a refactoring, you must coordinate with the OpenACS core
          team first. Also, such changes should have a discussion in the
          forums to allow for feedback from the whole community.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If you are changing the data model you *must* provide an
          upgrade script and bump up the version number of the
          package.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Consider any upgradability ramifications of your change.
          Avoid changing the contract and behaviour of Tcl procedures. If you
          want to build a new and clean API consider deprecating the old proc
          and making it invoke the new one.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Never rush to commit something. Before committing double
          check with cvs diff what exactly you are committing.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Always accompany a commit with a brief but informative
          comment. If your commit is related to bug number N and/or patch
          number P, indicate this in the commit comment by including &quot;bug N&quot;
          and/or &quot;patch P&quot;. This allows us to link bugs and patches in the
          Bug Tracker with changes to the source code. For example suppose
          you are committing a patch that closes a missing HTML tag, then an
          appropriate comment could be &quot;Fixing bug 321 by applying patch 134.
          Added missing h3 HTML close tag&quot;.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Commit one cohesive bug fix or feature change at a time.
          Don't put a bunch of unrelated changes into one commit.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Before you throw out or change a piece of code that you
          don't fully understand, use cvs annotate and cvs log on the file to
          see who wrote the code and why. Consider contacting the
          author.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Test your change before committing. Use the OpenACS
          package acs-automated-testing to test Tcl procedures and the tool
          
          <a href="http://tclwebtest.sourceforge.net" target="_top">
            Tclwebtest
          </a>

          to test pages
        </p></li><li><p>
          Keep code simple, adhere to conventions, and use comments
          liberally.
        </p></li><li><p>
          In general, treat the code with respect, at the same
          time, never stop questioning what you see. The code can always be
          improved, just make sure you change the code in a careful and
          systematic fashion.
