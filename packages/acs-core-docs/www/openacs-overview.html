        OpenACS (Open Architecture Community System) is an
        advanced toolkit for building scalable, community-oriented
        web applications.  If you're thinking of building an
        enterprise-level web application, OpenACS is a solid,
        scalable framework for building dynamic content driven
        sites.
      </p><p>
        OpenACS is a collection of pre-built applications and
        services that you can use to build your web
        site/application. Through a modular architecture, OpenACS
        has packages for user/groups management, content
        management, e-commerce, news, FAQs, calendar, forums, bug
        tracking, full-text searching, and <a class="ulink" href="http://openacs.org/packages/" target="_top">much
        more</a>.
      </p><p>
        OpenACS relies on <a class="ulink" href="http://www.aolserver.com/" target="_top">AOLserver</a>, the
        free, multithreaded, scalable, Tcl-enabled,
        web/application server used by America Online for most of
        its web sites, and a true ACID-compliant Relational
        Database Management System (RDBMS). Currently OpenACS
        supports PostgreSQL, an open source RDBMS, and Oracle and
        is easily extensible to other databases which support a
        comparable feature set.
      </p><p>
        The OpenACS toolkit is derived from the ArsDigita
        Community System (ACS). ArsDigita (now part of Red Hat,
        Inc.) kindly made their work available under the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" target="_top">GPL</a>,
        making all of this possible.
      </p><p>
        The OpenACS project was born when Don Baccus, Ben Adida, and
        others decided to port ACS from Oracle to PostgreSQL, thus
        making it a fully open-source solution.  With OpenACS 4,
        Oracle and PostgreSQL support were combined in one code base
        and with OpenACS 5, support for internationalization and
        localization has been added.
      </p><p>
        A vibrant and productive community has sprung up around the
        OpenACS software and there are many volunteer contributors
        as well as a commercial companies able to provide support,
        hosting, and custom development.  Many of the production
        users are actively funding and contributing work back to the
        project.  Formal, consensus driven governance has been
        established (with semi-annual elections) which ensures the
        project serves the needs of it's constituents.
