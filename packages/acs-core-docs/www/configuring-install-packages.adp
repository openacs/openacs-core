wasn't able to do before. You can have a weblog, a forums, a
calendar, or even do sophisticated project-management via your
website.</p><p>After you've installed OpenACS, you can congratulate yourself
for a job well done. Then, you'll probably want to install a couple
of packages.</p><p>To install packages, you have to be an administrator on the
OpenACS webserver. Log in, and you'll see a link to Admin or the
Control Panel. Click on that, then click on 'Install software'.
Packages are sometimes also referred to as applications or
software.</p><p>At this point, you'll need to determine whether or not you're
able to install from the repository, or whether you should install
from local files.</p><p>Basically, if you have a local CVS repository, or have custom
code, you need to install from 'Local Files'. Otherwise, you can
install from the OpenACS repository</p><p>If you want to install new packages, click on 'Install from
Repository' or 'Install from Local'. Select the package, and click
'Install checked applications'. The system will check to make sure
you have all necessary packages that the package you want depends
on. If you're installing from Local Files, and you are missing any
packages, you may have to add the packages your desired package
depends on: <a class="xref" href="upgrade-openacs-files" title="Upgrading the OpenACS files">the section called
&ldquo;Upgrading the OpenACS
files&rdquo;</a>
</p><p>If you run into any errors at all, check your
/var/lib/aolserver/$OPENACS_SERVICE_NAME/log/error.log file, and
post your error on the OpenACS forums</p><p>Once the package has been installed, then you will need to
'mount' the package. The next section handles that.</p>
