don't want them to have yet another. We want people to be able to
log in to OpenACS with the same password they use to log in to any
other system.</p><p>Besides, administrators have better things to do than create
accounts for people. So we want them to be able to create just one
account on a central server (e.g. LDAP or RADIUS), and when they
log on to OpenACS, an account will automatically be created for
them here.</p><p>Finally, security is increased with fewer passwords, since
users generally can't remember all those passwords, so they tend to
keep them all the same and never change them.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Design_Goal"></a>Design Goals</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Transparent: Users don't have to do anything special to
        get an account on the local OpenACS system, if they already have an
        account on the external authentication server.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fall-back: Users who don't have an account on the
        external authentication server are still allowed to create a local
        account on OpenACS. This could be for external students who should
        have access to .LRN, but not to the rest of the university's
        resources.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Authentication Client Only: We want OpenACS to be able to
        authenticate by asking some remote authority to verify the user's
        username/password combination. The goal is explicitly <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> (at this
        point) to have OpenACS act as an authentication server for other
        systems, although this could be easily added later. The goal is
        also <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to devise an infrastructure for letting OpenACS access
        resources in various other systems on the user's behalf, such as
        IMAP, iCalendar, SMB file servers, etc., although this is
        definitely an interesting use-case.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Easy configuration: We would like people to be able to
        configure this without having to write code. In particular, we want
        to build drivers that know how to talk with LDAP, RADIUS, PAM,
        etc., and which won't have to be locally modified. Only
        configuration and policies should change, code should
        not.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Usability: The solution must be easy to use for end users
        and administrators alike. There's frequently a positive feedback
        effect between usability and security, because when authentication
        schemes have poor usability, users will think up ways to circumvent
        them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open and modular: The design should be on the one hand
        open to add other authentification mechanisms when needed and on
        the other hand very modular to enable a start with minimal
        requirements (driver implementations) as soon as
        possible.</p></li></ul></div><p>The problem can be split into several logically separate

in the OpenACS users table. This can happen through a batch job, in
real-time, or both in combination.  We use the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.imsglobal.org/enterprise/index.html" target="_top">IMS Enterprise 1.1</a> specification. </p><p>Batch job means that we do a synchronization (import new
users, modify changed, purge deleted) on a regular interval, e.g.
every night. You can also decide to have a monthly full
synchronization, plus daily incremental ones. That's up to you. The
advantage is that you have all users in OpenACS, so when you search
for a user, you'll see all the organization's users, not just those
who happen to have used the OpenACS-based system. The down-side is
that it takes some time for user information to propagate. This can
be remedied by using the real-time solution.  The batch job will also
require error logging and an admin interface to view logs.</p><p>If an email already belongs to some
other user, we log it as an error.</p><p>A user will always belong to exactly one authority, which can be
either the "local" authority or some other. Thus, the OpenACS user's
table will have to be augmented with the following columns:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Authority. Reference to the site-wide authorities list. The
          authority which can authenticate this user.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Authority-specific username.</p></li></ul></div><p>Real-time means that the first time the user logs into
OpenACS, we'll query the authority that authenticated him
for information about this user. That authentication authority will
then give us at least first names, last name and email. The pros
and cons are the opposite of batch jobs. Using both in combination
is ideal.</p><p>Note: One solution to the "two users from different authorities
have the same email" problem above would be to allow users to
belong to multiple authorities. Then we would notice that the email
already exists, ask the user if he thinks he's the same person, and
if so, ask him to prove so by authenticating using the other
authority. Thus he'll have just authenticated in two different
authorities, and we can record that this is the same person. We'd still
have a problem if there was an email conflict between two accounts
on the same authority. Hm. I don't think it's worth spending too much
time trying to solve this problem through software.</p><div class="segmentedlist"><table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="90%"><tr><th width="15%">Feature</th><th width="8%">Status</th><th width="77%">Description</th></tr><thead><tr><th>EXT-AUTH-31</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="seglistitem"><td class="seg">EXT-AUTH-31</td><td class="seg">A</td><td class="seg">Upgrade user data model for ext-auth</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>After having authenticated using the relevant authority driver,
we'll look for the username/authority pair in the users table.</p><p>If we don't find any, that means that we're either not doing
batch synchronizing, or that the user has been added since the last
sync. In that case, we'll try to do a real-time synchronization, if
the driver supports it. If it does, it'll return email,
first_names, last_name, and other relevant information, and we'll
create a row in the local users table using that
information.</p><p>If that doesn't work, we'll tell the user that their account
isn't yet available, and the driver will supply a message for us,
which could say "The account should be available tomorrow. If not,
contact X."</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="Account_Registratio"></a>Account

          content, but won't let you modify anything or see personal data. A
          normal login becomes untrusted after a certain amount of time, and
          the user will have to re-enter his/her password in order to gain
          access to personal data. Untrusted login never expires, unless
          explicitly done so through either changing password or clicking a
          special "expire all logins" link.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Normal login: The user is logged, and has type his
          password sufficiently recently that we trust the login. All normal

          transactions.</p></li></ol></div><p>There are two advantages to this. First, when people's login
expires, we can ask them to re-enter only their password, and not
both username and password, since we'll still remember who they
were the last time their login was valid. This is a much faster
operation (the password input field will be focused by default, so
you just type your password and hit Return) that typing both
username and password, which will make it practical to have your
site configured to expire people's login after e.g. 2, 4, or 8
hours.</p><p>The other advantage is that we can still offer certain
functionality to you, even when your login is not trusted. For
example, we could let you browse publicly available forums, and
only when you want to post do you need to log in. This makes it
even more feasible to have a more secure login expiration
setting.</p><p>By default, <code class="literal">auth::require_login</code> would
bounce to the login page if the user is only logged in at the

to enter both email and password again. Unacceptable in
practice.</p><p>We should change the default, so a non-persistent login
doesn't expire until you either close your browser, or a few hours
have elapsed. Even if you are constantly active, the login should
still expire after at most x number of hours. We can still make the
login expire after a period of inactivity, but the amount of time
should be configurable and default to something reasonable like an
hour or so.</p><p>This will require looking into and changing the design of the

someone elses machine, that person will be forever logged in until
he/she explicitly logs out. You can change your password, you can
do anything you want, but unless a logout is requested from that
particular browser, that browser will be logged in forever.</p><p>I want to change our session handling code so that old login
cookies can be expired. This would be done automatically whenever
you change your password, and we could also offer a link which does
this without changing passwords. It's an important security
measure.</p><p>The implementation is simply to autogenerate some secret
token which is stored in the users table, and is also stored in the
cookie somehow. Then, whenever we want to expire all logins, we'll
just regenerate a new secret token, and the other cookies will be
void. Of course, we don't want to incur a DB hit on every request,
so we'll need to cache the secret token, or only check it when
refreshing the session cookie, which, I believe, normally happens
every 10 minutes or so.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="Recommended__Email_account_owner_on_password"></a>Recommended:

through these settings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Split: A regexp which will split the user's entry into
          username and authority parts. For example "^([^@]+)(@[^@]+)?$". An
          easier to use but less flexible method would be that you simply
          specify a certain character to split by, such as "@" or "\". If the
          regexp doesn't match, or in the latter case, if there's more than
          one occurrence of the specified character sequence, the split will
          fail, signaling that the user's entry was not valid.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Default authority: The default authority will be the first one
          in the sort order.</p></li></ul></div><p>The relevant code in user-login.tcl would look like
this:</p><pre class="programlisting">

    # bounce back to the form with a message saying that the login wasn't valid.

would be nice to add a feature to show who's currently online, a
nice real-time collaboration feature frequently requested by

integrated with a chat or instant messaging service like
Jabber.</p><p>What I'm concretely suggesting is that we keep a record of
which authenticated users have requested pags on the site in the
last x minutes (typically about 5), and thus are considered to be
currently online. There's nothing more to it. This lets us display
a list of "active users" somewhere on the site, and make their name
a link to a real-time chat service like Jabber.</p><p>We've already made the changes necessary to
security-procs.tcl to do this on an earlier project, but haven't

smart cards, personal certificates, etc.</p><p>I have chosen not to go this route, because I think that most

in favor of keeping this use-case out of the loop until we have
someone with a real requirement who could help us guide
development.</p><p>For now, OpenACS is still more of an integrated suite, it
doesn't access many outside applications. I think it would be
excellent for OpenACS to do so, e.g. by using an IMAP server to
store emails, an iCal server to store calendar appointments, LDAP
for user/group data and access control lists, SMB for file storage,
etc. But at the moment, we don't have any users of such things that
are ready. We have some who are on the steps, but let's wait till
