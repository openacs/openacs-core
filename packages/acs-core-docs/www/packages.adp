OpenACS. OpenACS packages are installed and maintained with the
OpenACS Package Manager (APM) which is part of the acs-admin

conventions for the file system and naming that must be followed,
and step by step instructions for creating a new package for the

<a name="packages-looks" id="packages-looks"></a>What a Package Looks Like</h3></div></div></div><p>Each package encapsulates all of its data model, library code,
logic, adminstration pages and user pages in a single part of the
file tree. This means developers can track down <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> that is related to a
particular package without hunting all over the file system.
Encapsulating everything about a package in one place also makes it
much easier to distribute packages independently from the OpenACS
Core.</p><p>In order to make this work, we need a system that keeps track of
the packages that have been installed in the server, where those
packages have been installed, and a standard way to map URLs that a
client sends to our server to the right page in the appropriate
package. While we're at it, this tool should also automate package
installation, dependency checking, upgrades, and package removal.
In OpenACS 5, this tool is called the <a class="link" href="packages" title="The APM">APM</a>.</p><p>

the general structure of a package, let's see what the package for
the "notes" application should look like.</p><div class="figure">

</colgroup><thead><tr>
<th>File Type</th><th>Its Use</th><th>Naming Convention</th>
</tr></thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Package Specification File</td><td>The package specification file is an XML file generated and
maintained by the OpenACS Package Manager (APM). It specifies
information about the package including its parameters and its
files.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">notes.info</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Data Model Creation Script</td><td>Contains the SQL that creates the necessary data model and
PL/SQL packages (or PL/pgSQL or whatever) to support the package.
The name must match the convention below or the package will not be
installed correctly. Notice that the script must be under the
appropriate directory for the database you are developing your
package for (hopefully all OpenACS-supported databases :-))</td><td><code class="computeroutput">sql/&lt;database&gt;/notes-create.sql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Data Model Drop Script</td><td>Contains the SQL that removes the data model and PL/SQL
packages generated by the creation script. The name must match the
convention below or the package will not be installed
correctly.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">sql/&lt;database&gt;/notes-drop.sql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Data Model File</td><td>Any .sql file that does not match the naming convention above
is recognized as a data model file. It is useful to separate the
SQL in the creation and drop scripts into several files and then
have the scripts source the other data model files. In Oracle this
can be done by including <span class="emphasis"><em>\@\@
filename</em></span> in the creation or drop scripts. See the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.orafaq.com/faqplus.htm#AT" target="_top">Oracle FAQ</a> for examples. In PostgreSQL the same
is acomplished by including <span class="emphasis"><em>\i
filename</em></span>.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">sql/&lt;database&gt;/*.sql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Data Model Upgrade Scripts</td><td>Contain changes to the data model between versions. The APM can
automatically load the appropriate upgrade scripts when upgrading
to a new version of a package.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">sql/&lt;database&gt;/upgrade/upgrade-&lt;old&gt;-&lt;new&gt;.sql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>SQL92 Query Files</td><td>Files with queries that are supported by all databases. These
are usually SQL92 queries. Notice that the .xql filename must match
the name of the .tcl file that uses those queries.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">*.xql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Oracle-specific Query Files</td><td>Files with queries that are Oracle-specific. Notice that the
.xql filename must match the name of the .tcl file that uses those
queries.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">*-oracle.xql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>PostgreSQL-specific Query Files</td><td>Files with queries that are PostgreSQL-specific. Notice that
the .xql filename must match the name of the .tcl file that uses
those queries.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">*-postgresql.xql</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tcl Library Files</td><td>The Tcl library files include a set of procedures that provide
an application programming interface (API) for the package to
utilize.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">tcl/notes-procs.tcl</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tcl Initialization</td><td>The initialization files are used to run Tcl procedures that
should only be sourced once on startup. Examples of statements to
put here are registered filters or procedures. Tcl initialization
files are sourced once on server startup after all of the Tcl
library files are sourced.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">tcl/notes-init.tcl</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Administration UI</td><td>The administration UI is used to administer the instances of
the package. For example, the forums administration UI is used to
create new forums, moderate postings, and create new categories for
forums postings.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/admin/*</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Administration UI Index Page</td><td>Every package administration UI must have an index page. In
most cases, this is <code class="computeroutput">index.tcl</code>
but it can be any file with the name <code class="computeroutput">index</code>, such as index.html or
index.adp.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/admin/index.tcl</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Regression Tests</td><td>Every package should have a set of regression tests that verify
that it is in working operation. These tests should be able to be
run at any time after the package has been installed and report
helpful error messages when there is a fault in the system.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/admin/tests/</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Regression Test Index Page</td><td>The regression test directory must have an index page that
displays all of the tests available and provides information on how
to run them. This file can have any extension, as long as its name
is <code class="computeroutput">index</code>.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/admin/tests/index.html</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Documentation</td><td>Every package must include a full set of documentation that
includes requirements and design documents, and user-level and
developer-level documentation where appropriate.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/doc/</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Documentation Index Page</td><td>The documentation directory must include a static HTML file
with the name of <code class="computeroutput">index.html</code>.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/doc/index.html</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>UI Logic Scripts</td><td>Packages provide a UI for users to access the system. The UI is
split into Logic and Templates. The logic scripts perform database
queries and prepare variables for presentation by the associated
templates.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/*.tcl</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>UI Templates</td><td>Templates are used to control the presentation of the UI.
Templates receive a set of data sources from the logic scripts and
prepare them for display to the browser.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/*.adp</code></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>UI Index Page</td><td>The UI must have an index page composed of a logic script
called <code class="computeroutput">index.tcl</code> and a template
called <code class="computeroutput">index.adp</code>.</td><td><code class="computeroutput">www/index.tcl</code></td>

APM</h3></div></div></div><p>The APM is used to create, maintain, and install packages. It
takes care of copying all of the files and registering the package
in the system. The APM is responsible for:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">

</ol></div><p>In addition for packages that are applications, the APM is
responsible for keeping track of where in the site a user must go
in order to use the application. To do this, the APM defines a set
of objects that we call <span class="emphasis"><em>package
instances</em></span>. Once a package is loaded, the administrator
can create as many instances of the package as she likes, and map
these instances to any URL in the site that she wants. If packages
are analogous to executable programs in an operating system, then
package instances are analgous to multiple running copies of a
single program. Each instance can be independently administered and
each instance maintains its own set of application parameters and
options.</p><p>The following sections will show you how to make a package for
the Notes application. In addition, they will discuss some site
management features in OpenACS 5 that take advantage of the APM's
package instance model. The two most important of these are
<span class="emphasis"><em>subsites</em></span>, and the
<span class="emphasis"><em>site map</em></span> tool, which can be
used to map applications to one or more arbitrary URLs in a running
site.</p><p>We will also discuss how to organize your files and queries so

<p>The directory that APM created will be empty except for the

then the "Scan the <code class="computeroutput">packages/notes</code> directory for additional

<a name="packages-subsites" id="packages-subsites"></a>The Site Map and Package Instances</h3></div></div></div><p>At this point, you are probably excited to see your new package
in action. But, we haven't added any user visible pages yet. By
convention, user visible pages go in the <code class="computeroutput">ROOT/packages/notes/www</code> directory. So go
there and add a file called <code class="computeroutput">hello.html</code> with some text in it. Now we
have to make the user pages visible in the site. Since we didn't
put the pages underneath <code class="computeroutput">ROOT/www</code> they will not appear on their own.
What we have to do is <span class="emphasis"><em>mount</em></span>
the application into the site map. That is, we have to define the
URL from which the application will serve its pages.</p><p>In OpenACS 5, administrators can define an arbitrary mapping
between the URLs the user types and the actual file in the file
system that is served. This mapping is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>site map</em></span> and entries in the site map are
called <span class="emphasis"><em>site nodes</em></span>. Each site
node maps a URL to an OpenACS object. Since package instances are
objects, the site map allows us to easily map package instances to
URLs. As we said before, each instance of an application has its
own set of parameters and runs from its own URL within the site.
What this means is that even though all the code for the
<code class="computeroutput">notes</code> application lives in
<code class="computeroutput">ROOT/packages/notes</code>, the
application itself can run from any number of locations in the
site. This allows developers and administrators to build sites that
look to the user like a collection of many indedendent applications
that actually run on a single shared code base. The <a class="link" href="request-processor" title="The Request Processor">request-processor</a> document shows you
how OpenACS figures out which instance of your application was
requested by the user at any given time. The <a class="link" href="subsites" title="Writing OpenACS Application Pages">page
development</a> tutorial shows you how to use this information in
your user interface.</p><p>In order to make the new <code class="computeroutput">notes</code> application visible to users, we have
to mount it in the site map. You do this by going to the <a class="ulink" href="/admin/site-map" target="_top">Site Map</a> page,
which is by default available at <code class="computeroutput">/acs-admin/site-map</code>. Use the interface here
to add a new sub-folder called <code class="computeroutput">notes</code> to the root of the site, then click
"new application" to mount a new instance of the <code class="computeroutput">notes</code> application to the site. Name the new
instance <code class="computeroutput">notes-1</code>.</p><p>Then type this URL into your browser: <code class="computeroutput">http://<span class="replaceable"><span class="replaceable">yourserver</span></span>/notes/hello.html</code>
</p><p>Now you should see the contents of the page that you added. What
has happened is that all URLs that start with <code class="computeroutput">/notes</code> have been mapped in such a way as to
serve content from the directory <code class="computeroutput">ROOT/packages/notes/www</code>. At this point, you
can experiment with the site map by mounting multiple instances of
the not yet written Notes application at various places in the
site. In a later document, we'll see how to write your application
so that the code can detect from what URL it was invoked. This is
the key to supporting <a class="link" href="subsites" title="Writing OpenACS Application Pages">subsites</a>.</p>
