<h2>ACS4 Unit Tests</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
Prior to using these unit tests, all testing had to be completed manually for
each revision of a module.  When a module is updated several times a day, this
can present a problem.  The solution adopted here is to create a suite of 
regression tests for each module to ensure that the required functionality
is not broken by new code.  The tests are constructed in such a way that they
can be run automatically, allowing developers to quickly determine if new
code breaks any functionality requirements.

<h3>Installation</h3>

The ACS4 unit testing suite requires several pieces of software to function.
First, you&#39;ll need to install <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</a>.
Ant is a build tool similar to make.  It&#39;s used to both build your test cases
and run the tests themselves.  The basic Ant functionality doesn&#39;t have 
everything needed to automate the testing, so you&#39;ll want to obtain David 
Eison&#39;s ForeachFileAntTask.java, available
at <a href="http://cvs.arsdigita.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.pl/acs-java-4/WEB-INF/src/com/arsdigita/build/">http://cvs.arsdigita.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.pl/acs-java-4/WEB-INF/src/com/arsdigita/build/</a>.  Compile the files and make sure that they
are in your classpath.

<p>

Once Ant is working, you&#39;ll need to obtain copies of both
<a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> and
<a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HTTPUnit</a>.  JUnit
is a framework to automate the running of unit tests, and HTTPUnit provides
an abstraction layer for HTTP.  These are both needed to compile the unit 
tests.  Again, make sure your classpath is up to date.
<p>

The final step is to replace the server properties in 
the build.xml file so it will know how to talk to your server.  You will need
to give it a base URL, a username, and password for that user.
are the "JVMARG" lines in the "JUNIT" section. ).  In the near future, this
will be moved out of the subdirectories and either into the toplevel build.xml
file or into a configuration file.

<p>

You should now be ready to run the tests.  Go to your server&#39;s "packages"
directory and type <code>source ./paths.sh</code> to set up your classpath.
Now type <code>ant</code>.  Ant should find the toplevel build.xml file,
check that it can see JUnit, compile your java files, and finally call Ant on 
each of the sub-directory build.xml files to run the tests.  You should 
be shown a report of which tests failed and which succeeded.

<p>

<h3>Adding Your Own Unit Tests</h3>

Adding new test cases is meant to be as easy as possible.  Simple create a
new function in the appropriate .java file, making sure that the function
name begins with "test".  I&#39;ve adopted a naming convention where the function
name consists of the word "test", a short description of what the function
does (with words delimited by underscores), followed finally by the QAS 
testcase ID, if such a testcase exists.  If you need to test an area of the 
site that requires a user id, you can use the ACSCommon.Login function in the
com.arsdigita.acs.acsKernel.test package to obtain a Session object with 
appropriate cookies.

<p>

Within the function, a typical unit test involves requesting a page, saving the result, checking the HTTP return code, then
parsing out various strings to check for page functionality.  The
return code should be checked with "assertEquals", and any other checks should
be performed with "assert".  Use of "assert", "assertEquals", and exceptions
allow JUnit to accurately report where a test fails.

<p>

If you need to create a set of tests for a module, the first step is to create
a directory tree beneath the module directory.  The current convention is to 
put all .java files in a "/java/src/com/arsdigita/acs/<i>module name</i>/test"
directory.  The <i>module name</i> should be the ACS module name, but with all
dashes removed and with appropriate capitilization.  All .java files that you
create that contain test cases must have the word Test in the filename.
All of the classes you
create should be in the com.arsdigita.acs.<i>module name</i>.test package, and
should import "com.dallaway.jsptest.*" and "junit.framework.*" (and optionally,
if needed, com.arsdigita.acs.acsKernel.ACSCommon).  Next, the
public class needs to extend "TestCase", and provide new method definitions
for "suite()" and the constructor.  Typically, in the constructor, you should
extract the system property "system.url" to determine which server to test
against.
