in order to make them appear on your website.</p><p>Make sure you are logged in, and then click on the 'Admin' or
'Control Panel' link to get to the Site-Wide Administration page
(at /acs-admin). Click on the subsite you'd like the application to
be available at.</p><p>Subsites are a way of dividing your website into logical chunks.
Often they represent different groups of users, or parts of an
organization.</p><p>Now click on 'Applications' (applications are the same thing as
packages). You'll see a list of Applications and the URLs that each
is located at. To mount a new application, you click on 'Add
application', enter the Application, title (application name), and
URL (URL folder name), and you're done.</p><p>Test it out now. The URL is based on a combination of the
subsite URL and the application URL. So if you installed a package
in the Main Subsite at the URL calendar, it will be available at
http://www.yoursite.com/calendar. If you installed it at a subsite
that has a URL intranet, then it would be located at
http://www.yoursite.com/intranet/calendar.</p>
