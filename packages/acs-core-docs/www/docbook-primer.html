      <span class="productname">OpenACS</span>™ is a powerful system with
      incredible possibilities and applications, but
      this power comes with some complexity and a steep learning curve
      that is only attenuated by good documentation.  Our goal is to write
      superb documentation, so that users, developers and administrators
      of OpenACS installations can enjoy the system.
    </p><p>
      The history of OpenACS documentation:  ..began by
      building on a good documentation base from ArsDigita's ACS in the
      late 1990's. Some sections of the documentation, however, lacked
      details and examples; others simply did not exist. The OpenACS
      community began meeting the challenge by identifying needs and
      writing documentation on an as needed basis.
    </p><p>
      By having documentation dependent on volunteers and code
      developers, documentation updates lagged behind the evolving
      system software.  As significant development changes were made
      to the system, existing documentation became dated, and its
      value significantly reduced. The valiant efforts that were made
      to keep the documentation current proved too difficult as
      changes to the system sometimes had far-reaching affects to
      pages throughout the documentation.  System integration and
      optimization quickly rendered documentation obsolete for
      developers.  The code became the substitute and source for
      documentation.
    </p><p>
      With thousands of lines of code and few developers tracking
      changes, features and advances to the OpenACS system went
      unnoticed or were not well understood except by the code
      authors.   Work was duplicated as a consequence of developers
      not realizing the significant work completed by others. New
      developers had to learn the system through experience with
      working with it and discussion in the forums.  Informal sharing
      of experiential and tacit knowledge has become the OpenACS
      community's main method of sharing knowledge.
    </p><p>
      This document attempts to shape ongoing documentation efforts by
      using principles of continual improvement to re-engineer
      documentation production.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="docs-managing"></a>Managing OpenACS Documentation</h3></div></div></div><p>  
      Documentation production shares many of the challenges of
      software development, such as managing contributions, revisions
      and the (editorial) release cycle. This is yet another
      experiment in improving documentation --this time by using
      principles of continual improvement to focus the on-going
      efforts. These processes are outlined as project management 
      phases:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>Requirements phase</strong></span> is about setting goals and
        specifications, and includes exploration of scenarios, use cases
        etc.  As an example, see the <a class="ulink" href="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/requirements-template.html" target="_top">
        OpenACS Documentation Requirements Template</a> which focuses on
        systems requirements for developers.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>Strategy phase</strong></span> is about creating an approach
        to doing work. It sets behavioral guidelines and boundaries
        that help keep perspective on how efforts are directed.
        OpenACS developers discuss strategy when coordinating
        efforts such as code revisioning and new features.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>Planning phase</strong></span> is about explicitly stating
        the way to implement the strategy as a set of methods.
        OpenACS system design requires planning. For example, see
        <a class="ulink" href="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/filename.html" target="_top">OpenACS
        documentation template</a> planning relating to package
        design. 
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>Implementation phase</strong></span> is about performing the
        work according to the plan, where decisions on how to handle
        unforseen circumstances are guided by the strategy and
        requirements.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="strong"><strong>Verification phase</strong></span> measures how well the plan
        was implemented. Success is measured by A) verifying if the
        project has met the established goals, and B) reviewing for
        ongoing problem areas etc.  OpenACS follows verification
        through different means on different projects, but in all
        cases, the OpenACS community verifies the project as a
        success through feedback including bug reports, user and
        administrator comments, and code changes.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      OpenACS forum discussions on documentation requirements and strategies are
      summarized in the following sections.  Production
      phases are mainly organized and fulfilled by a designated documentation maintainer.
      Hopefully the following sections will help spur greater
      direct participation by the OpenACS community.

      documentation requirements that have been expressed in the
      OpenACS forums to 4th July 2003.
    </p><p>
      OpenACS documentation should meet the following requirements. No

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

        qmail</a> is a recommended example of "rated high" online
        documentation.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Avoid requirements that significantly increase the labor
        required to maintain documentation.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Use best practices learned from the print world, web, and
          other media, about use of gamma, space, writing style etc.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Consistency in publishing -Establishing and adhering to publishing standards
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Use standardized language -Use international English
            (without slang or colloquial terms) for ESL (English as
            a second language) readers (and making translation
            easier for those interested in translating the
            documentation for internationalization efforts).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            All jargon used in documentation needs to be defined. 
            Use standardized terms when available, avoiding implicit
            understanding of specific OpenACS terms. 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Document titles (for example on html pages) should
            include whole document title (as in book title):
            (chapter title) : (section), so that bookmarks etc.
            indicate location in a manner similar to pages in books
            (in print publishing world).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Organize document according to the needs of the reader
            (which may be different than the wishes of the writers).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Do not make informal exclamations about difficulty/ease
            for users to complete tasks or understand... for
            example, "Simply...".  Readers come from many different
            backgrounds --remember that the greater audience is
            likely as varied as the readers on the internet--- If
            important, state pre-conditions or knowledge
            requirements etc. if different than the rest of the
            context of the document. For example, "requires basic
            competency with a text-based editor such as vi or emacs
            via telnet"
          </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Show where to find current information instead of writing
        about current info that becomes obsolete. If the information
        is not found elsewhere, then create one place for it, where
        others can refer to it. This structure of information will
        significantly reduce obsolescence in writing and labor burden
        to maintain up-to-date documentation. In other words, state
        facts in appropriately focused, designated areas only, then
        refer to them by reference (with links). 
      </p><p>
        Note: Sometimes facts should be stated multiple ways, to
        accommodate different reading style preferences. The should
        still be in 1 area, using a common layout of perhaps
        summary, introduction and discussion requiring increasing
        expertise, complexity or specificity.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Consistency in link descriptions -When link urls refer to
        whole documents, make the link (anchor wrapped title) that
        points to a document with the same title and/or heading of
        the document.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Consider OpenACS documentation as a set of books (an
        encyclopedic set organized like an atlas) that contains
        volumes (books).  Each book contains chapters and sections
        much like how DocBook examples are shown, where each chapter
        is a web page. This designation could help create an OpenACs
        book in print, and help new readers visualize how the
        documentation is organized. 
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        The use licenses between OpenACS and Arsdigita's ACS are not
        compatible, thereby creating strict limits on how much
        OpenACS developers should have access to Arsdigita code and
        resources.  The OpenACS documentation has a new legal
        requirement: to eliminate any dependency on learning about
        the system from Arsdigita ACS examples to minimize any
        inference of license noncompliance, while recognizing the
        important work accomplished by Philip Greenspun, Arsdigita,
        and the early ACS adopters.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Use a consistent general outline for each book.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Introduction (includes purpose/goal), Glossary of terms,

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Table of Contents (TOC)s for each book: the end-users, content and site
            administrators, marketing, developer tutorial, and
            developers.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Priorities of order and content vary based on each of
            the different readers mentioned. The developers guide
            should be organized to be most useful to the priorities
            of developers, while being consistent with the general
            documentation requirements including publishing strategy,
            style etc.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Use generic DocBook syntax to maximize reader familiarity with the documents.

            differentiate "product" by highlighting features,

            durability (handling of technological obsolescence),
            reliability, repairability, style of use, design

            well-matched systems etc).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            differentiate "service" by highlighting software

            Discussion and details should rely on meeting criteria
            of design, completeness of implementation, and related
            system strengths and weaknesses. Marketing should not
            rely on comparing to other technologies. Competitive
            analysis involves mapping out strengths, weaknesses,
            opportunities and threats when compared to other systems
            for a specific purpose, and thus is inappropriate (and
            becomes stale quickly) for general documentation.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            When identifying subsystems, such as tcl, include links
            to their marketing material if available.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            create an example/template comparison table that shows
            versions of OpenACS and other systems (commonly
            competing against OpenACS) versus a summary feature list
            and how well each meets the feature criteria.  Each
            system should be marked with a date to indicate time

        To build awareness about OpenACS, consider product

      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Explain/tutorial on how the UI works (links do more than go

      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Discuss criteria used to decide which features are
        important, and the quality of the implementation from a
        users perspective.  Each project implementation places a
        different emphasis on the various criteria, which is why
        providing a framework to help decide is probably more useful

        go deeper than high-level feature lists and look at the

        not the programmer's).  Example issues an end-user may have
        questions about: Ticket Tracker and Ticket Tracker Lite, why
        would I want one of them vs the other? And, before I specify
        to download and install it, what credit card gateways are

      OpenACS documentation development is subject to the
      constraints of the software project development and release
      methods and cycles (<a class="xref" href="cvs-guidelines.html#using-cvs-with-openacs" title="Using CVS with OpenACS">the section called “Using CVS with OpenACS”</a>).
      Essentially, all phases of work may be active to accommodate
      the asynchronous nature of multiple subprojects evolving by
      the efforts of a global base of participants with culturally
      diverse time references and scheduling idiosyncrasies.
    </p><p>
      The documentation strategy is to use project methods to
      involve others by collaborating or obtaining guidance or
      feedback (peer review) to distribute the workload and increase
      the overall value of output for the OpenACS project. 
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-why"></a>OpenACS Documentation Strategy: Why DocBook?</h3></div></div></div><p>
      OpenACS documentation is taking a dual approach to publishing.
    Documentation that is subject to rapid change and participation by
    the OpenACS community is managed through the <a class="ulink" href="http://openacs.org/xowiki/pages/en/Documentation_Project" target="_top">OpenACS
    xowiki Documentation Project</a>
    Formal documents that tend to remain static and require more
    expressive publishing tools will be marked up to conform to the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/xml/index.html" target="_top">DocBook XML
      DTD</a>. The remaining discussion is about publishing using
    Docbook.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="idp140400260213392"></a> 
      is a publishing standard based on XML with
      similar goals to the OpenACS Documentation project.  Some specific reasons why we are using DocBook:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>      
      It is open-source. 
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      A growing community surrounds DocBook (has 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html" target="_top">mailing lists</a>) 
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      A number of free and commercial 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.docbook.org/wiki/moin.cgi/DocBookTools" target="_top">tools</a> are available
      for editing and publishing DocBook documents. 
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      It enables us to publish in a variety of formats.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      XML separates content from presentation: It relieves each
      contributor of the burden of presentation, freeing each writer
      to focus on content and sharing knowledge.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      
      It is well tested technology. It has been in development
      since the <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/ch01.html#d0e2132" target="_top">early 1990's</a>). 
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Reasons why we are using Docbook XML instead of Docbook SGML:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Consistency</em></span> and history. We started with a collection 
    of DocBook XML files that ArsDigita wrote. Trying to re-write them to
    conform to the SGML DTD would be unnecessary work.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>XML does not require extra
      effort</em></span>. Writing in XML is almost identical to
    SGML, with a couple extra rules. More details in the
    <a class="ulink" href="http://en.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/docbookxml.html" target="_top">LDP Author Guide</a>.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>The tool chain has matured</em></span>. xsltproc and other XML 
    based tools have improved to the point where they are about as good as 
    the SGML tools. Both can output html and pdf formats.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Albeit, the road to using DocBook has had some trials. 
      In 2002, Docbook still was not fully capable of representing
      online books as practiced by book publishers and expected from
      readers with regards to usability on the web. That meant
      DocBook did not entirely meet OpenACS publishing requirements
      at that time.
    </p><p>
      In 2004, Docbook released version 4.4, which complies with all 
      the OpenACS publishing requirements.
      Producing a web friendly book hierarchy arguably remains DocBooks'
      weakest point. For example, a dynamically built document
      should be able to extract details of a specific reference from
      a bibliographic (table) and present a footnote  at the
      point where referenced. DocBook 4.4 allows for this with
      <code class="computeroutput">bibliocoverage</code>,
      <code class="computeroutput">bibliorelation</code>, and
      <code class="computeroutput">bibliosource</code>. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html" target="_top">DocBook:
      The Definitive Guide</a> is a good start for learning how
      to represent paper-based books online.

      After you have the tools mentioned above, you need to define a
      title for your document. Then start thinking about the possible
      sections and subsections you will have in your document. Make
      sure you coordinate with the OpenACS Gatekeepers to make sure
      you are not writing something that someone else is already
      writing. Also, if you desire to use the OpenACS CVS repository,
      please e-mail the gatekeeper in charge of documentation.

      The actual content is split up into documents that start at a
      <code class="computeroutput">sect1</code>-level. These are then tied together in a top-level document that 
      contains all the information above the line. This will be explained in more detail in a later document, 
      and we will provide a set of templates for documenting an entire package. </p><p>For now you can take a look at the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://openacs.org/cvs/openacs-4/packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/engineering-standards" target="_top">sources of these DocBook documents</a>
      to get an idea of how they are tied together.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-sections"></a>Headlines, Sections</h3></div></div></div><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258259152"></a>
      Given that your job starts at the <code class="computeroutput">sect1</code>-level, all your documents should open with a
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/sect1.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;sect1&gt;</code></a>-tag and end 
      with the corresponding <code class="computeroutput">&lt;/sect1&gt;</code>.
    </p><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258262912"></a>
      You need to feed every <code class="computeroutput">&lt;sect1&gt;</code> two attributes. The first attribute,
      <code class="computeroutput">id</code>, is standard and can be used with all elements. It comes in  very 
      handy when interlinking between documents (more about this when talking about links in <a class="xref" href="docbook-primer.html#dbprimer-links" title="Links">the section called “Links”</a>). 
      The value of <code class="computeroutput">id</code> has to be unique 
      throughout the book you're making since the <code class="computeroutput">id</code>'s in your 
      <code class="computeroutput">sect1</code>'s will turn into filenames when the book is parsed into HTML.
    </p><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258268032"></a>
      The other attribute is <code class="computeroutput">xreflabel</code>. The value of this is the text that will appear
      as the link when referring to this <code class="computeroutput">sect1</code>.
    </p><p>
      Right after the opening tag you put the title of the document - this is usually the same as 
      <code class="computeroutput">xreflabel</code>-attribute. E.g. the top level of the document you're
      reading right now looks like this:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;sect1 id="docbook-primer" xreflabel="DocBook Primer"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;DocBook Primer&lt;/title&gt;

...

&lt;/sect1&gt;
</pre><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258272432"></a>
      Inside this container your document will be split up into 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/sect2.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;sect2&gt;</code></a>'s,
      each with the same requirements - <code class="computeroutput">id</code> and <code class="computeroutput">xreflabel</code>
      attributes, and a <code class="computeroutput">&lt;title&gt;</code>-tag inside. Actually, the <code class="computeroutput">xreflabel</code> is never required in sections, but it makes linking to that section a lot easier.
    </p><p>
      When it comes to naming your
      <code class="computeroutput">sect2</code>'s and below, prefix them with some abbreviation of the <code class="computeroutput">id</code> in the <code class="computeroutput">sect1</code> such as <code class="computeroutput">requirements-overview</code>.

      For displaying a snippet of code, a filename or anything else you just want to appear as a part of
      a sentence, we use  
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/computeroutput.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;computeroutput&gt;</code></a>
      and <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/code.html" target="_top"><code class="code">&lt;code&gt;</code></a>
      tags.
      These replace the HTML-tag <code class="code">&lt;code&gt;</code> tag,
      depending on whether the tag is describing computer output or
      computer code.
    </p><p>
      For bigger chunks of code such as SQL-blocks, the tag 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/programlisting.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;programlisting&gt;</code></a> is used. Just wrap your code block in it; mono-spacing, indents and all that stuff is taken care of
      automatically. 
    </p><p>For expressing user interaction via a terminal window, we wrap
      the <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/screen.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;screen&gt;</code></a> 
      tag around text that has been wrapped by combinations of <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/computeroutput.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;computeroutput&gt;</code></a>

      Linking falls into two different categories: inside the book you're making and outside:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>1. Inside linking, cross-referencing other parts of your book</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        By having unique <code class="computeroutput">id</code>'s you can cross-reference any part of your book
        with a simple tag, regardless of where that part is.
      </p><p><a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258295296"></a>Check out how I link to a subsection of the Developer's Guide:</p><p>Put this in your XML:</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>
        Note that since I haven't provided an <code class="computeroutput">xreflabel</code> for the subsection, 
        <code class="computeroutput">packages-looks</code>, the

      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258328960"></a>
      Here's how you make the DocBook equivalent of the three usual HTML-lists:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>1. How to make an &lt;ul&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        Making an unordered list is pretty much like doing the same thing in HTML - if you close your <code class="computeroutput">&lt;li&gt;</code>, that is. The only differences are that each list item has to be wrapped in something more, such as
        <code class="computeroutput">&lt;para&gt;</code>, and that the tags are called
        <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/itemizedlist.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;itemizedlist&gt;</code></a>
        and
        <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/listitem.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;listitem&gt;</code></a>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;itemizedlist&gt;

  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;More stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;

&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;
</pre></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>2. How to make an &lt;ol&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        The ordered list is like the preceding, except that you use 
        <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/orderedlist.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;orderedlist&gt;</code></a> instead:</p><pre class="programlisting">

  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;More stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;

&lt;/orderedlist&gt;
</pre></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>3. How to make a &lt;dl&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        This kind of list is called a <code class="computeroutput">variablelist</code> and these are the tags you'll need to 
        make it happen:
        <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/variablelist.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;variablelist&gt;</code></a>,
        <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/varlistentry.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;varlistentry&gt;</code></a>, 
        <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/term.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;term&gt;</code></a> and

&lt;variablelist&gt;

  &lt;varlistentry&gt;
    &lt;term&gt;Heading (&lt;dt&gt;) goes here&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;And stuff (&lt;dd&gt;)goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;/varlistentry&gt;

  &lt;varlistentry&gt;
    &lt;term&gt;Another heading goes here&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;And more stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;/varlistentry&gt;

&lt;/variablelist&gt;

      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258349840"></a>
      DocBook supports several types of tables, but in most cases, the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/informaltable.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;informaltable&gt;</code></a>
      is enough:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;informaltable frame="all"&gt;
  &lt;tgroup cols="3"&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;a1&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;b1&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;c1&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;a2&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;b2&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;c2&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;a3&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;b3&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;c3&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/tgroup&gt;
&lt;/informaltable&gt;
</pre><p>
      With our current XSL-style-sheet, the output of the markup above will be a simple HTML-table:
    </p><div class="informaltable"><table cellspacing="0" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>a1</td><td>b1</td><td>c1</td></tr><tr><td>a2</td><td>b2</td><td>c2</td></tr><tr><td>a3</td><td>b3</td><td>c3</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
      If you want cells to span more than one row or column, it gets a bit more complicated - check out
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/table.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;table&gt;</code></a>
      for an example.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-emphasis"></a>Emphasis</h3></div></div></div><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140400258363600"></a>
      Our documentation uses two flavors of emphasis - italics and bold type. DocBook uses one - 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/emphasis.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;emphasis&gt;</code></a>.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="computeroutput">&lt;emphasis&gt;</code> tag defaults to italics when parsed. If you're looking for 
      emphasizing with bold type, use <code class="computeroutput">&lt;emphasis role="strong"&gt;</code>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-indexing"></a>Indexing Your DocBook Documents</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Words that are marked as index-words are referenced in an index

      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/primary.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;primary&gt;</code></a> and
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/secondary.html" target="_top"><code class="computeroutput">&lt;secondary&gt;</code></a>
      for this. See these links for an explanation.

      Once you have the <a class="xref" href="docbook-primer.html#dbprimer-validation" title="Tools">Docbook Tools</a>
      installed, you can convert your xml documents to HTML or other
      formats.
    </p><p>
      With the DocBook XSL stylesheets, generation of multiple files
      is controlled by the stylesheet. If you want to generate a
      single file, you call one stylesheet. If you want to generate
      multiple files, you call a different stylesheet. 
    </p><p>
      To generate a single HTML file from your DocBook XML file,
      use the command:
    </p><pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">bash$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>xsltproc -o outputfilename.xml /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/html/html.xsl filename.xml</code></strong>
</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      This example uses Daniel Veillard's <span class="strong"><strong>xsltproc</strong></span> command available
      as part of libxslt from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/" target="_top">http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/</a>.
      If you are using other XML processors such as Xalan or Saxon,
      you will need to change the command line appropriately.
      </p></div><p>
      To generate a set of linked HTML pages, with a separate page
      for each &lt;chapter&gt;, &lt;sect1&gt; or &lt;appendix&gt; tag, use the
      following command: 
    </p><pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">bash$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>xsltproc /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/html/chunk.xsl filename.xml</code></strong>
