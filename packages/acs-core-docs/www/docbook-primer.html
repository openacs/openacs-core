      <span class="productname">OpenACS</span>™ is a powerful system with
      incredible possibilities and applications, but
      this power comes with some complexity and a steep learning curve
      that is only attenuated by good documentation.  Our goal is to write
      superb documentation, so that users, developers and administrators
      of OpenACS installations can enjoy the system.
    </p><p>
      The history of OpenACS documentation:  ..began by
      building on a good documentation base from ArsDigita's ACS in the
      late 1990's. Some sections of the documentation, however, lacked
      details and examples; others simply did not exist. The OpenACS
      community began meeting the challenge by identifying needs and
      writing documentation on an as needed basis.
    </p><p>
      By having documentation dependent on volunteers and code
      developers, documentation updates lagged behind the evolving
      system software.  As significant development changes were made
      to the system, existing documentation became dated, and its
      value significantly reduced. The valiant efforts that were made
      to keep the documentation current proved too difficult as
      changes to the system sometimes had far-reaching affects to
      pages throughout the documentation.  System integration and
      optimization quickly rendered documentation obsolete for
      developers.  The code became the substitute and source for
      documentation.
    </p><p>
      With thousands of lines of code and few developers tracking
      changes, features and advances to the OpenACS system went
      unnoticed or were not well understood except by the code
      authors.   Work was duplicated as a consequence of developers
      not realizing the significant work completed by others. New
      developers had to learn the system through experience with
      working with it and discussion in the forums.  Informal sharing
      of experiential and tacit knowledge has become the OpenACS
      community's main method of sharing knowledge.
    </p><p>
      This document attempts to shape ongoing documentation efforts by
      using principles of continual improvement to re-engineer
      documentation production.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="docs-managing"></a>Managing OpenACS Documentation</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>  
      Documentation production shares many of the challenges of
      software development, such as managing contributions, revisions
      and the (editorial) release cycle. This is yet another
      experiment in improving documentation --this time by using
      principles of continual improvement to focus the on-going
      efforts. These processes are outlined as project management 
      phases:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
        <span class="strong">Requirements phase</span> is about setting goals and
        specifications, and includes exploration of scenarios, use cases
        etc.  As an example, see the <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/requirements-template.html" target="_top">
        OpenACS Documentation Requirements Template</a> which focuses on
        systems requirements for developers.
      </p></li><li><p>
        <span class="strong">Strategy phase</span> is about creating an approach
        to doing work. It sets behavioral guidelines and boundaries
        that help keep perspective on how efforts are directed.
        OpenACS developers discuss strategy when coordinating
        efforts such as code revisioning and new features.
      </p></li><li><p>
        <span class="strong">Planning phase</span> is about explicitly stating
        the way to implement the strategy as a set of methods.
        OpenACS system design requires planning. For example, see
        <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/filename.html" target="_top">OpenACS
        documentation template</a> planning relating to package
        design. 
      </p></li><li><p>
        <span class="strong">Implementation phase</span> is about performing the
        work according to the plan, where decisions on how to handle
        unforseen circumstances are guided by the strategy and
        requirements.
      </p></li><li><p>
        <span class="strong">Verification phase</span> measures how well the plan
        was implemented. Success is measured by A) verifying if the
        project has met the established goals, and B) reviewing for
        ongoing problem areas etc.  OpenACS follows verification
        through different means on different projects, but in all
        cases, the OpenACS community verifies the project as a
        success through feedback including bug reports, user and
        administrator comments, and code changes.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      OpenACS forum discussions on documentation requirements and strategies are
      summarized in the following sections.  Production
      phases are mainly organized and fulfilled by a designated documentation maintainer.
      Hopefully the following sections will help spur greater
      direct participation by the OpenACS community.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="docs-requirements"></a>OpenACS General Documentation Requirements</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      By the OpenACS Community. This section is a collection of
      documentation requirements that have been expressed in the
      OpenACS forums to 4th July 2003.
    </p><p>
      OpenACS documentation should meet the following requirements. No
      significance has been given to the order presented, topic breadth or depth here.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
        clarity in presentation. <a href="http://www.lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html" target="_top">Life with
        qmail</a> is a recommended example of &quot;rated high&quot; online
        documentation.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Avoid requirements that significantly increase the labor
        required to maintain documentation.
      </p></li><li><p>
          Use best practices learned from the print world, web, and
          other media, about use of gamma, space, writing style etc.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
            Consistency in publishing -Establishing and adhering to publishing standards
          </p></li><li><p>
            Use standardized language -Use international English
            (without slang or colloquial terms) for ESL (English as
            a second language) readers (and making translation
            easier for those interested in translating the
            documentation for internationalization efforts).
          </p></li><li><p>
            All jargon used in documentation needs to be defined. 
            Use standardized terms when available, avoiding implicit
            understanding of specific OpenACS terms. 
          </p></li><li><p>
            Document titles (for example on html pages) should
            include whole document title (as in book title):
            (chapter title) : (section), so that bookmarks etc.
            indicate location in a manner similar to pages in books
            (in print publishing world).
          </p></li><li><p>
            Organize document according to the needs of the reader
            (which may be different than the wishes of the writers).
          </p></li><li><p>
            Do not make informal exclamations about difficulty/ease
            for users to complete tasks or understand... for
            example, &quot;Simply...&quot;.  Readers come from many different
            backgrounds --remember that the greater audience is
            likely as varied as the readers on the internet--- If
            important, state pre-conditions or knowledge
            requirements etc. if different than the rest of the
            context of the document. For example, &quot;requires basic
            competency with a text-based editor such as vi or emacs
            via telnet&quot;
          </p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>
        Show where to find current information instead of writing
        about current info that becomes obsolete. If the information
        is not found elsewhere, then create one place for it, where
        others can refer to it. This structure of information will
        significantly reduce obsolescence in writing and labor burden
        to maintain up-to-date documentation. In other words, state
        facts in appropriately focused, designated areas only, then
        refer to them by reference (with links). 
      </p><p>
        Note: Sometimes facts should be stated multiple ways, to
        accommodate different reading style preferences. The should
        still be in 1 area, using a common layout of perhaps
        summary, introduction and discussion requiring increasing
        expertise, complexity or specificity.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Consistency in link descriptions -When link urls refer to
        whole documents, make the link (anchor wrapped title) that
        points to a document with the same title and/or heading of
        the document.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Consider OpenACS documentation as a set of books (an
        encyclopedic set organized like an atlas) that contains
        volumes (books).  Each book contains chapters and sections
        much like how DocBook examples are shown, where each chapter
        is a web page. This designation could help create an OpenACs
        book in print, and help new readers visualize how the
        documentation is organized. 
      </p></li><li><p>
        The use licenses between OpenACS and Arsdigita's ACS are not
        compatible, thereby creating strict limits on how much
        OpenACS developers should have access to Arsdigita code and
        resources.  The OpenACS documentation has a new legal
        requirement: to eliminate any dependency on learning about
        the system from Arsdigita ACS examples to minimize any
        inference of license noncompliance, while recognizing the
        important work accomplished by Philip Greenspun, Arsdigita,
        and the early ACS adopters.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Use a consistent general outline for each book.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
            Introduction (includes purpose/goal), Glossary of terms,
            Credits, License, Copyright, Revision History
          </p></li><li><p>
            Table of Contents (TOC)s for each book: the end-users, content and site
            administrators, marketing, developer tutorial, and
            developers.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Priorities of order and content vary based on each of
            the different readers mentioned. The developers guide
            should be organized to be most useful to the priorities
            of developers, while being consistent with the general
            documentation requirements including publishing strategy,
            style etc.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Use generic DocBook syntax to maximize reader familiarity with the documents.

      OpenACS end-user documentation should meet the following requirements. No

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          End-users should not have to read docs to use the system. 
        </p></li><li><p>
        Include how to get help. How and where to find answers,
        contact others, what to do if one gets an AOLserver or other
        error when using the system. Include types of available
        support (open-source, private commercial etc.) including
        references.
      </p></li><li><p>      
        Explain/foster understanding of the overall structure of the

        how it works, and how to find out more or dig deeper...  To
        promote the system by presenting the history of the system,
        and writing about some tacit knowledge re: OpenACS.org and
        the opensource culture.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Introduce and inspire readers about the uses, benefits, and
        the possibilities this system brings (think customer
        solution, customer cost, convenience, value). A
        comprehensive community communications system; How this
        system is valuable to users; Reasons others use OpenACS
        (with quotes in their own words) &quot;...the most important
        thing that the ACS does is manage users, i.e. provide  a way
        to group, view and manipulate members of the web community.
        -- Talli Somekh, September 19, 2001&quot;   using it to
        communicate, cooperate, collaborate... OpenACS offers
        directed content functionality with the OpenACS templating
        system.   ... OpenACS is more than a data collection and
        presentation tool. OpenACS has  management facilities that
        are absent in other portals.  ...The beauty of OpenACS is
        the simplicity (and scalability) of the platform on which it
        is built and the library of tried and tested community
        building tools that are waiting to be added. It seems that
        most portals just add another layer of complexity to the
        cake. See <a href="http://openacs.org/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=00058H&amp;topic_id=11&amp;topic=OpenACS" target="_top">Slides on OACS

        storage, wimpy point, ticket tracking.  An OpenACS tour; an
        abbreviated, interactive set of demo pages.
     </p></li><li><p>
        From a marketing perspective, 
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
            differentiate &quot;product&quot; by highlighting features,
            performance quality, conformance to standards,
            durability (handling of technological obsolescence),
            reliability, repairability, style of use, design
            (strategy in design, specifications, integrated,
            well-matched systems etc).
          </p></li><li><p>
            differentiate &quot;service&quot; by highlighting software
            availability (licensing and completeness from mature to early
            adopters or development versions), community incident
            support, project collaborative opportunities, and
            contractor support availability
          </p></li><li><p>
            differentiate price (economic considerations of
            opensource and features)
          </p></li><li><p>
            Discussion and details should rely on meeting criteria
            of design, completeness of implementation, and related
            system strengths and weaknesses. Marketing should not
            rely on comparing to other technologies. Competitive
            analysis involves mapping out strengths, weaknesses,
            opportunities and threats when compared to other systems
            for a specific purpose, and thus is inappropriate (and
            becomes stale quickly) for general documentation.
          </p></li><li><p>
            When identifying subsystems, such as tcl, include links
            to their marketing material if available.
          </p></li><li><p>
            create an example/template comparison table that shows
            versions of OpenACS and other systems (commonly
            competing against OpenACS) versus a summary feature list
            and how well each meets the feature criteria.  Each
            system should be marked with a date to indicate time
            information was gathered, since information is likely
            volatile. 
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
     </p></li><li><p>
        To build awareness about OpenACS, consider product
        differentiation: form, features, performance quality,
        conformance quality (to standards and requirements),
        durability, reliability, repairability, style, design: the
        deliberate planning of these product attributes.  
      </p></li><li><p>
        Include jargon definitions, glossary, FAQs, site map/index,
        including where to find Instructions for using the packages.
        FAQ should refer like answers to the same place for
        consistency, brevity and maintainability.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Explain/tutorial on how the UI works (links do more than go
        to places, they are active), Page flow, descriptions of form
        elements; browser/interface strengths and limitations (cookies, other)
      </p></li><li><p>
        Discuss criteria used to decide which features are
        important, and the quality of the implementation from a
        users perspective.  Each project implementation places a
        different emphasis on the various criteria, which is why
        providing a framework to help decide is probably more useful
        than an actual comparison.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Package documentation requirements have additional requirements.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
        A list of all packages, their names, their purposes, what
        they can and cannot do (strengths, limitations), what
        differentiates them from similar packages, minimal
        description, current version, implementation status,
        author/maintainers, link(s) to more info.  Current version
        available at the <a href="http://openacs.org/repository/5-2/" target="_top">repository</a>.
       </p></li><li><p>
        Include dependencies/requirements, known conflicts, and
        comments from the real world edited into a longer
        description to quickly learn if a package is appropriate for
        specific projects.
       </p></li><li><p>
        Create a long bulleted list of features. Feature list should
        go deeper than high-level feature lists and look at the
        quality of the implementations (from the user's perspective,
        not the programmer's).  Example issues an end-user may have
        questions about: Ticket Tracker and Ticket Tracker Lite, why
        would I want one of them vs the other? And, before I specify
        to download and install it, what credit card gateways are
        supported by the current e-commerce module? There are some
        packages where the name is clear enough, but what are the
        limitations of the standard package?
      </p></li><li><p>
        End-user docs should not be duplicative. The package
        description information and almost everything about a
        package for administrators and developers is already
        described in the package itself through two basic
        development document templates: a <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/current/requirements-template.html" target="_top">
        Requirements Template</a> and <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/current/filename.html" target="_top">Detailed

      OpenACS documentation development is subject to the
      constraints of the software project development and release
      methods and cycles (???).
      Essentially, all phases of work may be active to accommodate
      the asynchronous nature of multiple subprojects evolving by
      the efforts of a global base of participants with culturally
      diverse time references and scheduling idiosyncrasies.
    </p><p>
      The documentation strategy is to use project methods to
      involve others by collaborating or obtaining guidance or
      feedback (peer review) to distribute the workload and increase
      the overall value of output for the OpenACS project. 
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-why"></a>OpenACS Documentation Strategy: Why DocBook?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      OpenACS documentation is taking a dual approach to publishing.
    Documentation that is subject to rapid change and participation by
    the OpenACS community is managed through the <a href="http://openacs.org/xowiki/pages/en/Documentation_Project" target="_top">OpenACS
    xowiki Documentation Project</a>
    Formal documents that tend to remain static and require more
    expressive publishing tools will be marked up to conform to the
      <a href="http://docbook.org/xml/index.html" target="_top">DocBook XML
      DTD</a>. The remaining discussion is about publishing using
    Docbook.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id3072034"></a> 
      is a publishing standard based on XML with
      similar goals to the OpenACS Documentation project.  Some specific reasons why we are using DocBook:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>      
      It is open-source. 
      </p></li><li><p>
      A growing community surrounds DocBook (has 
      <a href="http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html" target="_top">mailing lists</a>) 
      </p></li><li><p>
      A number of free and commercial 
      <a href="http://www.docbook.org/wiki/moin.cgi/DocBookTools" target="_top">tools</a> are available
      for editing and publishing DocBook documents. 
      </p></li><li><p>
      It enables us to publish in a variety of formats.
      </p></li><li><p>
      XML separates content from presentation: It relieves each
      contributor of the burden of presentation, freeing each writer
      to focus on content and sharing knowledge.
      </p></li><li><p>      
      It is well tested technology. It has been in development
      since the <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/ch01.html#d0e2132" target="_top">early 1990's</a>). 
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Reasons why we are using Docbook XML instead of Docbook SGML:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Consistency</em></span> and history. We started with a collection 
    of DocBook XML files that ArsDigita wrote. Trying to re-write them to
    conform to the SGML DTD would be unnecessary work.
    </p></li><li><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>XML does not require extra
      effort</em></span>. Writing in XML is almost identical to
    SGML, with a couple extra rules. More details in the
    <a href="http://en.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/docbookxml.html" target="_top">LDP Author Guide</a>.
    </p></li><li><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>The tool chain has matured</em></span>. xsltproc and other XML 
    based tools have improved to the point where they are about as good as 
    the SGML tools. Both can output html and pdf formats.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Albeit, the road to using DocBook has had some trials. 
      In 2002, Docbook still was not fully capable of representing
      online books as practiced by book publishers and expected from
      readers with regards to usability on the web. That meant
      DocBook did not entirely meet OpenACS publishing requirements
      at that time.
    </p><p>
      In 2004, Docbook released version 4.4, which complies with all 
      the OpenACS publishing requirements.
      Producing a web friendly book hierarchy arguably remains DocBooks'
      weakest point. For example, a dynamically built document
      should be able to extract details of a specific reference from
      a bibliographic (table) and present a footnote  at the
      point where referenced. DocBook 4.4 allows for this with
      <tt class="computeroutput">bibliocoverage</tt>,
      <tt class="computeroutput">bibliorelation</tt>, and
      <tt class="computeroutput">bibliosource</tt>. <a href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html" target="_top">DocBook:
      The Definitive Guide</a> is a good start for learning how
      to represent paper-based books online.
    </p><p>
      The following DocBook primer walks you through the basics, and should cover the
      needs for 95 percent of the documentation we produce. You are welcome to explore DocBook's
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/part2.html" target="_top">
    list of elements</a> and use more exotic features in your
      documents. The list is made up of SGML-elements but basically
      the same elements are valid in the XML DTD <span class="strong">as long as you remember to</span>:
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3024437"></a>
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

      <span class="strong">not use other tag minimization</span>
    </p></li><li><p>
      Write all elements and attributes in lowercase
    </p></li><li><p>
      Quote all attributes

      You are going to need the following to work with the OpenACS
      Docbook XML documentation:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
    <a href="http://docbook.org/xml/index.html" target="_top">Docbook XML
    DTD</a> - The document type definition for XML. You can
    find an RPM or DEB package or you can download a zip file from
    the site linked from here.
    </p></li><li><p>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/" target="_top">XSL
    Stylesheets</a> (docbook-xsl) - The stylesheets to convert
    to HTML. We have been using a stylesheet based upon
    NWalsh's chunk.xsl.
    </p></li><li><p>
    <tt class="computeroutput">xsltproc</tt> - The processor that
    will take an XML document and, given a xsl stylesheet, convert
    it to HTML. It needs libxml2 and libxslt (available in RPM and
    DEB formats or from <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/" target="_top">xmlsoft.org</a>.  
    </p></li><li><p>
    Some editing tool. A popular one is Emacs with the psgml and nXML
    modes. The <a href="http://en.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/" target="_top">LDP Author
    Guide</a> and <a href="http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookAuthoringTools" target="_top">DocBook

      After you have the tools mentioned above, you need to define a
      title for your document. Then start thinking about the possible
      sections and subsections you will have in your document. Make
      sure you coordinate with the OpenACS Gatekeepers to make sure
      you are not writing something that someone else is already
      writing. Also, if you desire to use the OpenACS CVS repository,
      please e-mail the gatekeeper in charge of documentation.
    </p><p>
      You can look at some templates for documents (in Docbook XML) in
      the <a href="http://openacs.org/cvs/openacs-4/packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/engineering-standards" target="_top">sources
      for acs-core-docs</a>, especially the <span class="emphasis"><em>

      The documentation for each package will make up a little &quot;book&quot; that is structured like this 
      - examples are <span class="emphasis"><em>emphasized</em></span>:

      <a class="indexterm" name="id3024670"></a>

                    ...         : <span class="strong">...</span>
    </pre><p>
      The actual content is split up into documents that start at a
      <tt class="computeroutput">sect1</tt>-level. These are then tied together in a top-level document that 
      contains all the information above the line. This will be explained in more detail in a later document, 
      and we will provide a set of templates for documenting an entire package. </p><p>For now you can take a look at the
      <a href="http://openacs.org/cvs/openacs-4/packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/engineering-standards" target="_top">sources of these DocBook documents</a>
      to get an idea of how they are tied together.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-sections"></a>Headlines, Sections</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3024801"></a>
      Given that your job starts at the <tt class="computeroutput">sect1</tt>-level, all your documents should open with a
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/sect1.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;sect1&gt;</tt></a>-tag and end 
      with the corresponding <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;/sect1&gt;</tt>.
    </p><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3024843"></a>
      You need to feed every <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;sect1&gt;</tt> two attributes. The first attribute,
      <tt class="computeroutput">id</tt>, is standard and can be used with all elements. It comes in  very 
      handy when interlinking between documents (more about this when talking about links in <a href="docbook-primer.html#dbprimer-links" title="Links">Section , “Links”</a>). 
      The value of <tt class="computeroutput">id</tt> has to be unique 
      throughout the book you're making since the <tt class="computeroutput">id</tt>'s in your 
      <tt class="computeroutput">sect1</tt>'s will turn into filenames when the book is parsed into HTML.
    </p><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3031287"></a>
      The other attribute is <tt class="computeroutput">xreflabel</tt>. The value of this is the text that will appear
      as the link when referring to this <tt class="computeroutput">sect1</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Right after the opening tag you put the title of the document - this is usually the same as 
      <tt class="computeroutput">xreflabel</tt>-attribute. E.g. the top level of the document you're
      reading right now looks like this:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;sect1 id=&quot;docbook-primer&quot; xreflabel=&quot;DocBook Primer&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;DocBook Primer&lt;/title&gt;

...

&lt;/sect1&gt;
</pre><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3031339"></a>
      Inside this container your document will be split up into 
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/sect2.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;sect2&gt;</tt></a>'s,
      each with the same requirements - <tt class="computeroutput">id</tt> and <tt class="computeroutput">xreflabel</tt>
      attributes, and a <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;title&gt;</tt>-tag inside. Actually, the <tt class="computeroutput">xreflabel</tt> is never required in sections, but it makes linking to that section a lot easier.
    </p><p>
      When it comes to naming your
      <tt class="computeroutput">sect2</tt>'s and below, prefix them with some abbreviation of the <tt class="computeroutput">id</tt> in the <tt class="computeroutput">sect1</tt> such as <tt class="computeroutput">requirements-overview</tt>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-code"></a>Code</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

      For displaying a snippet of code, a filename or anything else you just want to appear as a part of
      a sentence, we use  
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/computeroutput.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;computeroutput&gt;</tt></a>
      and <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/code.html" target="_top"><font color="red">&lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</font></a>
      tags.
      These replace the HTML-tag <font color="red">&lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</font> tag,
      depending on whether the tag is describing computer output or
      computer code.
    </p><p>
      For bigger chunks of code such as SQL-blocks, the tag 
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/programlisting.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;programlisting&gt;</tt></a> is used. Just wrap your code block in it; mono-spacing, indents and all that stuff is taken care of
      automatically.

      Linking falls into two different categories: inside the book you're making and outside:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong">1. Inside linking, cross-referencing other parts of your book</span></span></dt><dd><p>
        By having unique <tt class="computeroutput">id</tt>'s you can cross-reference any part of your book
        with a simple tag, regardless of where that part is.
      </p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id3031600"></a>Check out how I link to a subsection of the Developer's Guide:</p><p>Put this in your XML:</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>And the output is:</p><pre class="programlisting">
- Find information about creating a package in 
<a href="packages.html#packages-making-a-package">Making a Package</a>.
</pre><p>
        Note that even though this is an empty tag, you have to either:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
        Provide the end-tag, <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;/xref&gt;</tt>, or
          </p></li><li><p>
        Put a slash before the ending-bracket: <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;xref linkend=&quot;blahblah&quot;/&gt;</tt>
          </p></li></ol></div><p>If the section you link to hasn't a specified <tt class="computeroutput">xreflabel</tt>-attribute,
        the link is going to look like this:</p><p>Put this in your XML:</p><pre class="programlisting">

- Find information about what a package looks like in 
<a href="packages.html#packages-looks" title="What a Package Looks Like">Section , “What a Package Looks Like”</a>.
</pre><p>
        Note that since I haven't provided an <tt class="computeroutput">xreflabel</tt> for the subsection, 
        <tt class="computeroutput">packages-looks</tt>, the
        parser will try its best to explain where the link takes you.

        <a class="indexterm" name="id3031772"></a>
        If you're hyper-linking out of the documentation, it works almost the same way as HTML - the tag is just
        a little different

        (<a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/ulink.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;ulink&gt;</tt></a>):

    </p><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3031870"></a>
      To insert a graphic we use the elements

      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/textobject.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;textobject&gt;</tt></a>.
      Two versions of all graphics are required. One for the Web
      (usually a JPEG or GIF), and a brief text description.  The
      description becomes the ALT text. You can also supply a version for print (EPS).

      <a class="indexterm" name="id3032815"></a>
      Here's how you make the DocBook equivalent of the three usual HTML-lists:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong">1. How to make an &lt;ul&gt;</span></span></dt><dd><p>
        Making an unordered list is pretty much like doing the same thing in HTML - if you close your <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;li&gt;</tt>, that is. The only differences are that each list item has to be wrapped in something more, such as
        <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;para&gt;</tt>, and that the tags are called
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/itemizedlist.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;itemizedlist&gt;</tt></a>
        and
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/listitem.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;listitem&gt;</tt></a>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;itemizedlist&gt;

  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;More stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;

&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;
</pre></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong">2. How to make an &lt;ol&gt;</span></span></dt><dd><p>
        The ordered list is like the preceding, except that you use 
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/orderedlist.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;orderedlist&gt;</tt></a> instead:</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;orderedlist&gt;

  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;More stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;

&lt;/orderedlist&gt;
</pre></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong">3. How to make a &lt;dl&gt;</span></span></dt><dd><p>
        This kind of list is called a <tt class="computeroutput">variablelist</tt> and these are the tags you'll need to 
        make it happen:
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/variablelist.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;variablelist&gt;</tt></a>,
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/varlistentry.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;varlistentry&gt;</tt></a>, 
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/term.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;term&gt;</tt></a> and
        <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/listitem.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;listitem&gt;</tt></a>:</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;variablelist&gt;

  &lt;varlistentry&gt;
    &lt;term&gt;Heading (&lt;dt&gt;) goes here&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;And stuff (&lt;dd&gt;)goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;/varlistentry&gt;

  &lt;varlistentry&gt;
    &lt;term&gt;Another heading goes here&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;And more stuff goes here&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
  &lt;/varlistentry&gt;

&lt;/variablelist&gt;
</pre></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-tables"></a>Tables</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3033046"></a>
      DocBook supports several types of tables, but in most cases, the
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/informaltable.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;informaltable&gt;</tt></a>
      is enough:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;informaltable frame=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tgroup cols=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;a1&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;b1&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;c1&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;a2&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;b2&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;c2&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;a3&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;b3&lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry&gt;c3&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/tgroup&gt;
&lt;/informaltable&gt;
</pre><p>
      With our current XSL-style-sheet, the output of the markup above will be a simple HTML-table:
    </p><div class="informaltable"><table cellspacing="0" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>a1</td><td>b1</td><td>c1</td></tr><tr><td>a2</td><td>b2</td><td>c2</td></tr><tr><td>a3</td><td>b3</td><td>c3</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
      If you want cells to span more than one row or column, it gets a bit more complicated - check out
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/table.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;table&gt;</tt></a>
      for an example.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-emphasis"></a>Emphasis</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="id3033193"></a>
      Our documentation uses two flavors of emphasis - italics and bold type. DocBook uses one - 
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/emphasis.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;emphasis&gt;</tt></a>.
    </p><p>
      The <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;emphasis&gt;</tt> tag defaults to italics when parsed. If you're looking for 
      emphasizing with bold type, use <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;emphasis role=&quot;strong&quot;&gt;</tt>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dbprimer-indexing"></a>Indexing Your DocBook Documents</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      Words that are marked as index-words are referenced in an index
      in the final, parsed document.
    </p><p>
      Use
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/indexterm.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;indexterm&gt;</tt></a>,
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/primary.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;primary&gt;</tt></a> and
      <a href="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/secondary.html" target="_top"><tt class="computeroutput">&lt;secondary&gt;</tt></a>
      for this. See these links for an explanation.

      Once you have the <a href="docbook-primer.html#dbprimer-validation">Docbook Tools</a>
      installed, you can convert your xml documents to HTML or other
      formats.
    </p><p>
      With the DocBook XSL stylesheets, generation of multiple files
      is controlled by the stylesheet. If you want to generate a
      single file, you call one stylesheet. If you want to generate
      multiple files, you call a different stylesheet. 
    </p><p>
      To generate a single HTML file from your DocBook XML file,
      use the command:
    </p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="computeroutput">bash$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>xsltproc -o outputfilename.xml /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/html/html.xsl filename.xml</tt></b>
</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      This example uses Daniel Veillard's <span class="strong">xsltproc</span> command available
      as part of libxslt from <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/" target="_top">http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/</a>.
      If you are using other XML processors such as Xalan or Saxon,
      you will need to change the command line appropriately.
      </p></div><p>
      To generate a set of linked HTML pages, with a separate page
      for each &lt;chapter&gt;, &lt;sect1&gt; or &lt;appendix&gt; tag, use the
      following command: 
    </p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="computeroutput">bash$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>xsltproc /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/html/chunk.xsl filename.xml</tt></b>
