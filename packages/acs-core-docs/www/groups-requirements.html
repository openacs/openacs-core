      grouping of users. The OpenACS 4 Parties and Groups system is intended to provide
      the flexibility needed to model complex real-world organizational structures,
      particularly to support powerful subsite services; that is, where one OpenACS
      installation can support what appears to the user as distinct web services
      for different user communities.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="groups-requirements-vision"></a>Vision Statement</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>A powerful web service that can meet the needs of large enterprises must
      be able to model the the real world's very rich organizational structures
      and many ways of decomposing the same organization. For example, a
      corporation can be broken into structures (the corporation, its divisions,
      and their departments) or regions (the Boston office, the LA office); a
      person who is employed by (is a member of) a specific department is also a
      member of the division and the corporation, and works at (is a member of, but
      in a different sense) a particular office. OpenACS's Parties and Groups
      system will support such complex relations faithfully.</p><p><span class="strong">Historical Motivations</span></p><p>The primary limitation of the OpenACS 3.x user group system is that it
      restricts the application developer to representing a &quot;flat group&quot;
      that contains only users: The <tt class="computeroutput">user_groups</tt> table may contain the
      <tt class="computeroutput">group_id</tt> of a parent group, but parent-child relationship
      support is limited because it only allows one kind of relationship between
      groups to be represented. Moreover, the Oracle database's limited support
      for tree-like structures makes the queries over these relationships
      expensive.</p><p>In addition, the Module Scoping design in OpenACS 3.0 introduced a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>party</em></span> abstraction - a thing that is a person or a group of people -
      though not in the form of an explicit table. Rather, the triple of
      <tt class="computeroutput">scope</tt>, <tt class="computeroutput">user_id</tt>, and <tt class="computeroutput">group_id</tt> columns
      was used to identify the party. One disadvantage of this design convention is
      that it increases a data model's complexity by requiring the programmer
      to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>add these three columns to each &quot;scoped&quot; table</p></li><li><p>define a multi-column check constraint to protect against data corruption
          (e.g., a row with a <tt class="computeroutput">scope</tt> value of &quot;group&quot; but a null
          <tt class="computeroutput">group_id</tt>)</p></li><li><p>perform extra checks in <tt class="computeroutput">Tcl</tt> and <tt class="computeroutput">PL/SQL</tt>
          functions and procedures to check both the <tt class="computeroutput">user_id</tt> and
          <tt class="computeroutput">group_id</tt> values</p></li></ul></div><p>In sum, the goal of the <span class="strong">Parties and Groups</span> system is to
      provide OpenACS programmers and site administrators with simple tools that fully
      describe the complex relationships that exist among groups in the real
      world.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="groups-requirements-user-scenarios"></a>User Scenarios</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Pat Developer has a client project and wants to model the company, its
      offices, its divisions, and its departments as groups and the employees as
      users.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="groups-requirements-system-overview"></a>System Overview</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>We start with <span class="strong">Groups</span>, which contain members; the
      <span class="strong">member can be either a person or another group</span> (i.e. a
      member is a party).</p><p>In addition to membership, the party and groups system defines a
      <span class="strong">composition</span> relationship that may exist between groups: A
      group can be a <span class="strong">component</span> of another group. The child group
      is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>component group</em></span>; the parent group is called a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>composite group</em></span>.</p><p>A group <span class="strong">G<sub>c</sub></span> can be a member and/or a component
      of another group <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span>; the difference is in the way
      the members of <span class="strong">G<sub>c</sub></span> are related to
      <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If a party <span class="strong">P</span> is a member (or a component) of
          <span class="strong">G<sub>c</sub></span> and if <span class="strong">G<sub>c</sub></span> is a
          component of <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span>, then <span class="strong">P</span> is also
          a member (or a component) of <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span></p></li><li><p>If a party <span class="strong">P</span> is a member (or a component) of
          <span class="strong">G<sub>c</sub></span> and if <span class="strong">G<sub>c</sub></span> is a
          member of <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span>, then <span class="strong">no
            relationship</span> between <span class="strong">P</span> and
          <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span> exists as a result of the relationship between
          <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span> and <span class="strong">G<sub>p</sub></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Consider an example to make this less abstract: Pretend that the Sierra
      Club is a <span class="emphasis"><em>member</em></span> of Greenpeace. The Sierra Club has chapters; each
      chapter is a <span class="emphasis"><em>component</em></span> of the Sierra Club. If Eddie Environmentalist
      is a member of the Massachusetts Chapter of the Sierra Club, Eddie is
      automatically a member of the Sierra Club, but being a Sierra Club member
      does not make Eddie a member of Greenpeace.</p><p>In the OpenACS, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and the Sierra Club chapters would be
      modeled as groups, and Eddie would be a user. There would be a composition
      relationship between each Sierra Club chapter and the Sierra Club. Membership
      relationships would exist between Eddie and the Massachusetts Chapter,
      between Eddie and the Sierra Club (due to Eddie's membership in the
      Massachusetts chapter), and between the Sierra Club and Greenpeace.</p><p>Membership requirements can vary from group to group. The parties and
      groups system must provide a base type that specifies the bare minimum
      necessary to join a group.</p><p>The parties and groups system must support constraints between a composite
      group <span class="strong">G<sub>P</sub></span> and any of its component groups,
      <span class="strong">G<sub>C</sub></span>. For example, the system should be able to
      enforce a rule like: Do not allow a party <span class="strong">P</span> to become a
      member of <span class="strong">G<sub>C</sub></span> unless <span class="strong">P</span> is already
      a member of <span class="strong">G<sub>P</sub></span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="groups-requirements-links"></a>Related Links</h3></div></div><div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a href="groups-design.html">OpenACS 4 Groups Design</a></p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="groups-requirements-data-model"></a>Requirements: Data Model</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The data model for the parties and groups system must provide support for
