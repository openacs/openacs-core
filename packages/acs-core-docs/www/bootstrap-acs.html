Before OpenACS 3.3, the OpenACS startup process was extremely simple: after AOLserver
performed its internal initialization (reading the configuration file,
loading shared libraries and module code, etc.) it scanned through the Tcl
library directory (generally <tt>/web/</tt><span class="emphasis"><em><tt>yourservername</tt></em></span><tt>/tcl</tt>),
sourcing each file in sequence. 
</p><p>While this overall structure for initialization is still intact, package
management has thrown a wrench into the works - there are a few extra things
to do during initialization, most notably:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Examine the OpenACS file tree for files that should not be present in OpenACS
(i.e., that were once part of the OpenACS distribution but have since been
removed).</p></li><li><p>Scan the <tt>/packages</tt> directory for new packages.</p></li><li><p>Initialize enabled packages by sourcing their <tt>*-procs.tcl</tt>
and <tt>*-init.tcl</tt> files.</p></li></ul></div><p>
This document examines in detail each of the steps involved in AOLserver/OpenACS
startup. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bootstrap-acs-startup-process"></a>The Startup Process</h3></div></div><p>
As soon as the <tt>nsd</tt> daemon is executed by the <tt>init</tt>
process (or otherwise), AOLserver reads its configuration file and
<tt>chroot</tt>s itself if necessary. It then loads shared libraries
indicated in the <tt>.ini</tt> file (e.g., the Oracle driver and
<tt>nssock</tt>), and sources Tcl module files (generally in
<tt>/home/aol30/modules/tcl</tt>). This step is, and has always been, the
same for all AOLservers, regardless of whether they are running OpenACS. 
</p><p>Next AOLserver sources, in lexicographical order, each file in the
<tt>/tcl</tt> directory. The first such file is
<tt>0-acs-init.tcl</tt>, which doesn't do much directly except to
determine the OpenACS path root (e.g., <tt>/web/</tt><span class="emphasis"><em><tt>yourservername</tt></em></span>)
by trimming the final component from the path to the Tcl library directory
(<tt>/web/</tt><span class="emphasis"><em><tt>yourservername</tt></em></span><tt>/tcl</tt>). But
<tt>0-acs-init.tcl</tt>'s has an important function, namely sourcing
<tt>/packages/acs-core/bootstrap.tcl</tt>, which does the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Initialize some NSVs used by the core</em></span>. These NSVs are
documented in <tt>/packages/acs-core/apm-procs.tcl</tt> - no need to
worry about them unless you're an OpenACS core hacker. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Verify the deletion of obsolete OpenACS files</em></span>. The
<tt>/tcl</tt> directory has evolved quite a bit over the months and
years, and a few files have come and gone. The
<tt>/www/doc/removed-files.txt</tt> file contains a list of files which
<span class="emphasis"><em>must be deleted</em></span> from the AOLserver installation, at the risk of
causing weird conflicts, e.g., having several security filters registered.
<tt>bootstrap.tcl</tt> scans through this list, logging error messages to
the log if any of these files exist. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Source <tt>*-procs.tcl</tt> files in the OpenACS core</em></span>.
We source each file matching the <tt>*-procs.tcl</tt> glob in the
<tt>/packages/acs-kernel</tt> directory, in lexicographical order. These
procedure are needed to perform any of the following steps. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Ensure that the database is available</em></span> by grabbing and
releasing a handle. If we can't obtain a handle, we terminate
initialization (since OpenACS couldn't possibly start up the server without
access to the database). 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Register any new packages in the <tt>/packages</tt>
directory</em></span>. In each directory inside <tt>/packages</tt>, we look
for a <tt>.info</tt> file; if we find a package that hasn't yet been
registered with the package manager (i.e., it's been copied there
manually), we insert information about it into the database. (The first time
OpenACS starts up, <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> packages will have been registered in the database
yet, so this step will registers every single package in the
<tt>/packages</tt> directory.) Note that packages discovered here are
initially disabled; they must be manually enabled in the package manager
before they can be used. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Ensure that the <tt>acs-kernel</tt> package is
enabled</em></span>. If the OpenACS core isn't initialized, the server
couldn't possibly be operational, so if there's no enabled version of
the OpenACS core we simply mark the latest installed one as enabled. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Load <tt>*-procs.tcl</tt> files for enabled
packages</em></span>, activating their APIs. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Load <tt>*-init.tcl</tt> files for enabled packages</em></span>,
giving packages a chance to register filters and procedures, initialize data
structures, etc. 

</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><em>Verify that the core has been properly initialized</em></span> by
checking for the existence of an NSV created by the request processor
initialization code. If it's not present, the server won't be
operational, so we log an error.</p></li></ol></div><p>
At this point, <tt>bootstrap.tcl</tt> is done executing. AOLserver
proceeds to source the remaining files in the <tt>/tcl</tt> directory
(i.e., unpackaged libraries) and begins listening for connections.
