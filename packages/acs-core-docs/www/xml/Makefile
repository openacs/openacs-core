# A very simple Makefile to generate the HTML docs
# @author Vinod Kurup (vinod@kurup.com)
# @author Modified by Roberto Mello (rmello@fslc.usu.edu) to have PDF generation
#         plus refactored it a bit to have rules and dependencies.
# @author davis@xarg.net Added automatic creation of an XSL link so we don't edit openacs.xsl, 
#         added a lint target which runs xmllint, changed pdf generation to use FOP.  Made it 
#         work on the mac.  
# macOS note: xmllint from fink does not work, use /usr/bin/xmllint 
#           xmllint from fink seems to work fine on osx 10.4.x

#
# This simply copies all the 'files' and 'images'
#   to the appropriate directory in www so that they are accessible
#
# It then moves into the www directory and runs the XSLT generation
# and runs htmldoc to generate PDFs.
#
# I'm a Makefile newbie, so feel free to comment/slash/change.
