    <title>Overview of OpenACS Documentation</title>
    <para>
      <productname>OpenACS</productname> is a powerful system with
      incredible possibilities and applications, but
      this power comes with some complexity and a steep learning curve
      that is only attenuated by good documentation.  Our goal is to write
      superb documentation, so that users, developers and administrators
      of OpenACS installations can enjoy the system.
    </para>
 
    <para>
      The history of OpenACS documentation:  ..began by
      building on a good documentation base from ArsDigita&#39;s ACS in the
      late 1990's. Some sections of the documentation, however, lacked
      details and examples; others simply did not exist. The OpenACS
      community began meeting the challenge by identifying needs and
      writing documentation on an as needed basis.
    </para>

    <para>
      By having documentation dependent on volunteers and code
      developers, documentation updates lagged behind the evolving
      system software.  As significant development changes were made
      to the system, existing documentation became dated, and its
      value significantly reduced. The valiant efforts that were made
      to keep the documentation current proved too difficult as
      changes to the system sometimes had far-reaching affects to
      pages throughout the documentation.  System integration and
      optimization quickly rendered documentation obsolete for
      developers.  The code became the substitute and source for
      documentation.
    </para>
    <para>
      With thousands of lines of code and few developers tracking
      changes, features and advances to the OpenACS system went
      unnoticed or were not well understood except by the code
      authors.   Work was duplicated as a consequence of developers
      not realizing the significant work completed by others. New
      developers had to learn the system through experience with
      working with it and discussion in the forums.  Informal sharing
      of experiential and tacit knowledge has become the OpenACS
      community&#39;s main method of sharing knowledge.
    </para>

      This document attempts to shape ongoing documentation efforts by
      using principles of continual improvement to re-engineer
      documentation production.

    <title>Managing OpenACS Documentation</title>
    <para>  
      Documentation production shares many of the challenges of
      software development, such as managing contributions, revisions
      and the (editorial) release cycle. This is yet another
      experiment in improving documentation --this time by using
      principles of continual improvement to focus the on-going
      efforts. These processes are outlined as project management 
      phases:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Requirements phase</emphasis> is about setting goals and
        specifications, and includes exploration of scenarios, use cases
        etc.  As an example, see the <ulink
        url="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/requirements-template.html">
        OpenACS Documentation Requirements Template</ulink> which focuses on
        systems requirements for developers.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Strategy phase</emphasis> is about creating an approach
        to doing work. It sets behavioral guidelines and boundaries
        that help keep perspective on how efforts are directed.
        OpenACS developers discuss strategy when coordinating
        efforts such as code revisioning and new features.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Planning phase</emphasis> is about explicitly stating
        the way to implement the strategy as a set of methods.
        OpenACS system design requires planning. For example, see
        <ulink
        url="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/filename.html">OpenACS
        documentation template</ulink> planning relating to package
        design. 
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Implementation phase</emphasis> is about performing the
        work according to the plan, where decisions on how to handle
        unforseen circumstances are guided by the strategy and
        requirements.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Verification phase</emphasis> measures how well the plan
        was implemented. Success is measured by A) verifying if the
        project has met the established goals, and B) reviewing for
        ongoing problem areas etc.  OpenACS follows verification
        through different means on different projects, but in all
        cases, the OpenACS community verifies the project as a
        success through feedback including bug reports, user and
        administrator comments, and code changes.

      OpenACS forum discussions on documentation requirements and strategies are
      summarized in the following sections.  Production
      phases are mainly organized and fulfilled by a designated documentation maintainer.
      Hopefully the following sections will help spur greater
      direct participation by the OpenACS community.

        Consider OpenACS documentation as a set of books (an

        volumes (books).  Each book contains chapters and sections
        much like how DocBook examples are shown, where each chapter
        is a web page. This designation could help create an OpenACs
        book in print, and help new readers visualize how the
        documentation is organized.

        The use licenses between OpenACS and Arsdigita&#39;s ACS are not
        compatible, thereby creating strict limits on how much
        OpenACS developers should have access to Arsdigita code and
        resources.  The OpenACS documentation has a new legal
        requirement: to eliminate any dependency on learning about
        the system from Arsdigita ACS examples to minimize any
        inference of license noncompliance, while recognizing the
        important work accomplished by Philip Greenspun, Arsdigita,
        and the early ACS adopters.

    <para>
      OpenACS documentation development is subject to the
      constraints of the software project development and release
      methods and cycles (<xref linkend="using-cvs-with-openacs"/>).
      Essentially, all phases of work may be active to accommodate
      the asynchronous nature of multiple subprojects evolving by
      the efforts of a global base of participants with culturally
      diverse time references and scheduling idiosyncrasies.
    </para>
    <para>
      The documentation strategy is to use project methods to
      involve others by collaborating or obtaining guidance or
      feedback (peer review) to distribute the workload and increase
      the overall value of output for the OpenACS project.

      Albeit, the road to using DocBook has had some trials. 
      In 2002, Docbook still was not fully capable of representing
      online books as practiced by book publishers and expected from
      readers with regards to usability on the web. That meant
      DocBook did not entirely meet OpenACS publishing requirements
      at that time.
    </para>
    <para>
      In 2004, Docbook released version 4.4, which complies with all 
      the OpenACS publishing requirements.
      Producing a web friendly book hierarchy arguably remains DocBooks'
      weakest point. For example, a dynamically built document
      should be able to extract details of a specific reference from
      a bibliographic (table) and present a footnote  at the
      point where referenced. DocBook 4.4 allows for this with
      <computeroutput>bibliocoverage</computeroutput>,
      <computeroutput>bibliorelation</computeroutput>, and
      <computeroutput>bibliosource</computeroutput>. <ulink

      <ulink url="https://github.com/openacs/openacs-core/tree/oacs-5-9/packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/engineering-standards">sources of these DocBook documents</ulink>
      to get an idea of how they are tied together.

  <sect2 id="dbprimer-sections">
    <title>Headlines, Sections</title>

    <para>
      <indexterm><primary>Sections</primary><secondary>Headlines</secondary></indexterm>
      Given that your job starts at the <computeroutput>sect1</computeroutput>-level, all your documents should open with a
      <ulink url="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/sect1.html"><computeroutput>&lt;sect1&gt;</computeroutput></ulink>-tag and end 
      with the corresponding <computeroutput>&lt;/sect1&gt;</computeroutput>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <indexterm><primary>sect1</primary></indexterm>
      You need to feed every <computeroutput>&lt;sect1&gt;</computeroutput> two attributes. The first attribute,
      <computeroutput>id</computeroutput>, is standard and can be used with all elements. It comes in  very 
      handy when interlinking between documents (more about this when talking about links in <xref linkend="dbprimer-links"/>). 
      The value of <computeroutput>id</computeroutput> has to be unique 
      throughout the book you&#39;re making since the <computeroutput>id</computeroutput>'s in your 
      <computeroutput>sect1</computeroutput>'s will turn into filenames when the book is parsed into HTML.
    </para>

    <para>
      <indexterm><primary>xreflabel</primary></indexterm>
      The other attribute is <computeroutput>xreflabel</computeroutput>. The value of this is the text that will appear
      as the link when referring to this <computeroutput>sect1</computeroutput>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Right after the opening tag you put the title of the document - this is usually the same as 
      <computeroutput>xreflabel</computeroutput>-attribute. E.g. the top level of the document you&#39;re
      reading right now looks like this:
    </para>

    <programlisting>
&lt;sect1 id="docbook-primer" xreflabel="DocBook Primer"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;DocBook Primer&lt;/title&gt;

...

&lt;/sect1&gt;
</programlisting>

    <para>
      <indexterm><primary>sect2</primary></indexterm>
      Inside this container your document will be split up into 
      <ulink url="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/sect2.html"><computeroutput>&lt;sect2&gt;</computeroutput></ulink>'s,
      each with the same requirements - <computeroutput>id</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>xreflabel</computeroutput>
      attributes, and a <computeroutput>&lt;title&gt;</computeroutput>-tag inside. Actually, the <computeroutput>xreflabel</computeroutput> is never required in sections, but it makes linking to that section a lot easier.
    </para>

    <para>
      When it comes to naming your
      <computeroutput>sect2</computeroutput>'s and below, prefix them with some abbreviation of the <computeroutput>id</computeroutput> in the <computeroutput>sect1</computeroutput> such as <computeroutput>requirements-overview</computeroutput>.

      For displaying a snippet of code, a filename or anything else you just want to appear as a part of
      a sentence, we use  
      <ulink

      and <ulink

      tags.
      These replace the HTML-tag <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag,
      depending on whether the tag is describing computer output or
      computer code.
    </para>

    <para>
      For bigger chunks of code such as SQL-blocks, the tag 
      <ulink url="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/programlisting.html"><computeroutput>&lt;programlisting&gt;</computeroutput></ulink> is used. Just wrap your code block in it; mono-spacing, indents and all that stuff is taken care of
      automatically.

    <para>For expressing user interaction via a terminal window, we wrap
      the <ulink
