    <title>Using CVS with OpenACS</title>
    <sect3>
      <title>Getting Started</title>
      <para>
        All OpenACS code is available anonymously.  To get code
      anonymously, use the parameter
      <computeroutput>-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot</computeroutput> immediately after <computeroutput>cvs</computeroutput> in a cvs command to check out or export code.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you are an OpenACS developer, you should check out code so
        that you or any other developer can commit it.  To do this, use
        the parameter
        <computeroutput>-d:ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot</computeroutput>
        immediately after <computeroutput>cvs</computeroutput> in
        checkout commands.  This will create a local checkout directory
        that uses cvs.openacs.org but does not specify the user.  By
        default, it will use your local account name as the user, so if
        you are logged in as "foobar" it will try to check out and
        commit as if you had specified
        <computeroutput>:ext:foobar@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot</computeroutput>.  The advantage of not specifying a user in the checkout command is that other users can work in the directory using their own accounts.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        OpenACS.org supports non-anonymous cvs access only over ssh, so you
        must have <computeroutput>CVS_RSH=ssh</computeroutput> in your
        environment.  (Typically this is accomplished by putting
        <computeroutput>export CVS_RSH=ssh</computeroutput> into
        <computeroutput>~/.bash_profile</computeroutput>.).  If your local
        account name does not match your cvs.openacs.org account name, create a
        file <computeroutput>~/.ssh/config</computeroutput> with an entry
        like:
      </para>
      <programlisting>Host cvs.openacs.org
    User joel
</programlisting>
      <para>
        With this setup, you will be asked for your password with
        each cvs command.  To avoid this, set up ssh certificate
        authentication for your OpenACS account.  (<ulink
        url="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server">More
        information</ulink>)
      </para>

      <para>
        You may want to set some more default actions for CVS usage.
  To do so, create the file
        <computeroutput>~/.cvsrc</computeroutput> with the contents:
      </para>
      <screen><action>cvs -z6
cvs -q</action></screen>
      <para><computeroutput>-z6</computeroutput> speeds up cvs access over the network quite a bit by enabling compressed
        connection by default.  <computeroutput>-q</computeroutput> suppresses some verbose output from commands.  For example, it makes the output of <computeroutput>cvs up</computeroutput> much easier to read.</para>

      <title>Checkout for Package Development</title>
      <para>If you are actively developing a non-core package, you
      should work from the latest core release branch.  Currently this
      is &releasebranch;.  This ensures that you are working on top
      of a stable OpenACS core, but still allows you to commit feature
      changes to non-core packages.  To check out all packages,</para>
      <screen><action>cvs -d :ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot co -r &releasebranch; openacs-4</action></screen>
      <para>If you work in the directories created with this command, all of your
            cvs updates and commits will be confined to the &releasebranch;
            branch.  Your work will be merged back to HEAD for you
            with each release.</para>
            
      <para>Because the entire openacs-4 directory is large, you may
      want to use only acs-core plus some specific modules.  To do
      this, check out core first:</para>
      <screen><action>cvs -d:ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot -r &releasebranch; checkout acs-core</action></screen>
      <para>Then add modules as needed:</para>
      <screen><action>cd /var/lib/aolserver/<replaceable>service0</replaceable>/packages
cvs up -d <replaceable>packagename</replaceable></action></screen>

      <para>... where <replaceable>packagename</replaceable> is the
            name of the package you want. Visit the <ulink
            url="http://openacs.org/packages"> Package
            Inventory</ulink> and <ulink

      <title>Checkout for Core Development</title>
      <para>If you are actively developing packages in the OpenACS
      Core, work from the HEAD branch.  HEAD is used for active
              development of the next version of core OpenACS. It may be very
              buggy; it may not even install correctly. Do not use this branch for
              development of non-core features unless your work depends on some
              of the HEAD core work. To check out HEAD, omit the
              <computeroutput>-r</computeroutput> tag.</para>
      <para></para>
      <para>To check out HEAD for development, which requires an OpenACS developer account:</para>
      <screen><action>cvs -d:ext:cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot checkout acs-core</action></screen>
      <para>To check out HEAD anonymously:</para>

      <title>Checkout .LRN</title>
      <para>
        .LRN consists of a given version OpenACS core, plus a set of
        packages. These are collectively packages together to form a
        distribution of .LRN. F .LRN 2.0.0 sits on top of OpenACS 5.0.0.
        .LRN also uses an OpenACS install.xml file during installation;
        this file is distributed within the dotlrn package and must be
        moved. To get a development checkout of .LRN in the subdirectory
        <literal>dotlrn</literal>:
      </para>
      <screen><action>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.openacs.org:/cvsroot checkout -r &releasebranch; acs-core
mv openacs-4 dotlrn

    <para>
      Once you have a checkout you can use some commands to track
      what has changed since you checked out your copy.  <computeroutput>cvs -n update</computeroutput> does not change any files, but reports which changes have been updated or locally modified, or are not present in CVS.
    </para>
    <para>To update your files, use <computeroutput>cvs update</computeroutput>.  This will merge changes from the repository with your local files.  It has no effect on the cvs.openacs.org repository.</para>

      <title>Modules</title>
      <para>
        All OpenACS code resides within a single CVS module, <computeroutput>openacs-4</computeroutput>.  (The openacs-4 directory contains code for all versions of OpenACS 4 and later, and .LRN 1 and later.)   Checking out this module retrieves all OpenACS code of any type.  For convenience, subsets of <computeroutput>openacs-4</computeroutput> are repackaged as smaller modules.</para>
        
        <para>
          <computeroutput>acs-core</computeroutput> contains only critical common
          packages. It does not have any user applications, such as forums,
          bug-tracker, calendar, or ecommerce.  These can be added at
          any time.

        Tags and Branches
      </title>
      <para>
        Tags and Branches look similar in commands, but behave differently. A tag is a fixed point on a branch.  Check out
            a tag to get a specific version of OpenACS. Check out a branch to
            get the most current code for that major-minor version (e.g., 5.0.x
            or 5.1.x). You can only commit to a branch, not a tag, so check out
            a branch if you will be working on the code. </para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
            <para><computeroutput>openacs-<replaceable>x</replaceable>-<replaceable>y</replaceable>-<replaceable>z</replaceable>-final</computeroutput>
            tags mark final releases of OpenACS.  This tag is applied to the acs-core files for an OpenACS core release, and to the latest released versions of all other packages at the time of release.  Example: <computeroutput>openacs-5-0-4-final</computeroutput>.
                </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
            <para><computeroutput>dotlrn-<replaceable>x</replaceable>-<replaceable>y</replaceable>-<replaceable>z</replaceable>-final</computeroutput>
            tags mark final releases of .LRN.  These tags apply only to .LRN packages.  Example: <computeroutput>dotlrn-2-0-1-final</computeroutput>
                </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
            <para><computeroutput><replaceable>packagename</replaceable>-<replaceable>x</replaceable>-<replaceable>y</replaceable>-<replaceable>z</replaceable>-final</computeroutput>
                  tags apply to releases of individual packages.  For example, <computeroutput>calendar-2-0-0-final</computeroutput> is a tag that will retrieve only the files in the calendar 2.0.0 release. It applies only to the
                  calendar package. All non-core, non-dotlrn packages should have a
                  tag of this style, based on the package name. Many packages have
                  not been re-released since the new naming convention was adopted
                  and so don&#39;t have a tag of this type.
                </para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
            <para><computeroutput>openacs-<replaceable>x</replaceable>-<replaceable>y</replaceable>-compat</computeroutput> tags point to the most recent released version of OpenACS <replaceable>X</replaceable>.<replaceable>Y</replaceable>.
            It is similar to openacs-x-y-z-compat, except that it will
            always get the most recent dot-release of Core and the
            most recent compatible, released version of all other
            packages.  All of the other tag styles should be static,
            but -compat tags may change over time. If you want version
            5.0.4 exactly, use the openacs-5-0-4-final tag. If you want the best newest released code in the 5.0.x release series and you want to upgrade within 5.0.x later, use the compat tag. 
            </para>
            <para>
              For example, if you check out the entire tree with -r
              openacs-5-0-compat, you might get version 5.0.4 of each OpenACS
              core package, version 2.0.1 of calendar, version 2.0.3 of each .LRN
              package, etc. If you update the checkout two months later, you
              might get version 5.0.5 of all OpenACS core packages and version
              2.1 of calendar.
            </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>oacs-<replaceable>x</replaceable>-<replaceable>y</replaceable> is a <emphasis>branch, </emphasis>, not a tag.  All core packages in the 5.0 release series (5.0.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, etc) are also on the oacs-5-0 branch.  Similarly, OpenACS core packages for 5.1.0 are on the oacs-5-1 branch.</para>
                <para>These branches are used for two purposes.  OpenACS
                Core packages on these branches are being tidied up for
            release.  Only bug fixes, not new features, should be
            added to core packages on release branches.  For all other
            packages, release branches are the recommended location
            for development.  For example, if you are working on
            calendar, which is compatible with OpenACS 5.0 but not
                5.1, work on the oacs-5-0 branch.</para>

              if OpenACS 5.1.0 is released, developers should work on the
              oacs-5-1 branch. When oacs-5-2 is branched, developers should

              When a package is released in final form, the developer
              shall tag it "packagename-x-y-z-final" and "openacs-x-y-compat". x-y
              should correspond to the current branch. If the package is

      <para>
        <emphasis>Reason 1: The packagename tag is a permanent,
        static tag that allows for future comparison. The compat tag is a
        floating tag which is used by the repository generator to determine
        the most recent released version of each package for each core
        version. This allows package developers to publish their releases
        to all users of automatic upgrade without any intervention from the
        OpenACS release team.Reason 2: The compat tags allows CVS users to
        identify packages which have been released since the last core
        release.Reason 3: The compat tag or something similar is required
        to make Rule 6 possible.</emphasis>

            </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>
        Reason: This allows OpenACS developers who are creating
        extensively customized sites to branch from a tag which is stable,
        corresponds to released code instead of development code, and
        applies to all packages. This tag can be used to fork packages as
        needed, and provides a common ancestor between the fork and the
        OpenACS code so that patches can be generated.

          For example, adding a new API function wouldn&#39;t require a
