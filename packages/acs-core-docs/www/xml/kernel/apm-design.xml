<para>
In general terms, a <emphasis role="strong">package</emphasis> is a unit of software that
serves a single well-defined purpose. That purpose may be to provide a
service directly to one or more classes of end-user, (e.g., discussion forums
and file storage for community members, user profiling tools for the site
publisher), or it may be to act as a building block for other packages (e.g.,
an application programming interface (API) for storing and querying access
control rules, or an API for scheduling email alerts). Thus, packages fall
into one of two categories: 
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">OpenACS Applications:</emphasis> a &quot;program or group of programs
designed for end users&quot; (the <ulink url="http://www.pcwebopaedia.com/TERM/a/application.html">Webopedia
definition</ulink>); also known as <emphasis>modules</emphasis>, for historical reasons.
Examples of applications include <ulink url="/doc/forums">Forums</ulink> and <ulink url="/doc/news">News</ulink>. 


</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">OpenACS Services:</emphasis> the aforementioned building blocks.
Examples of services include the <ulink url="/doc/acs-content-repository">OpenACS
Content Repository</ulink>, the <ulink url="/doc/acs-templating">OpenACS Templating
System</ulink>, and the <link linkend="kernel-doc">OpenACS Kernel</link>, which includes
APM.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>An installation of the OpenACS includes the OpenACS Kernel, some services that
extend the kernel&#39;s functionality, and some applications intended for
end-users. Packages function as individual pieces of <link linkend="subsites-design">subsites</link>. A subsite can contain multiple
application and service instances that provide the end-user with capabilities
and content customized to the particular subsite.</para>

<para>This architecture supports the growth of collaborative commerce. For
example, Jane User starts a forum focusing on the merits of View Cameras by
creating an instance of the Forum application for her personal subsite on an
OpenACS Installation. Jack User discovers Jane&#39;s forum and includes a link to
it in his subsite. As interest in Jane&#39;s forum grows, she creates a
subsite specializing in providing information about View cameras. This
subsite now includes several package instances beyond Forum; it could
potentially include its own Ecommerce capabilities (ala <ulink url="http://shopping.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Shopping</ulink>). This could include a
knowledge management application that allows users to spread expertise about
view cameras and a portal application that links to reliable camera models
and resellers. Any subsite enabled package that is added to the OpenACS
installation through APM is another potential package instance that can
become part of Jane&#39;s View Camera subsite.</para>

<para>The APM provides an architecture for packaging software, making instances
of that software available to subsites, specifying configuration parameters
for each instance, and managing the creation and release of new packages.</para>

<sect2 id="apm-design-hist-considerations">
<title>Historical Considerations</title>

<para>
Prior to ACS 3.3, all packages were lumped together into one monolithic
distribution without explicit boundaries; the only way to ascertain what
comprised a given package was to look at the top of the corresponding
documentation page, where, by convention, the package developer would specify
where to find: 
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the data model</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>the Tcl procedures</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>the user-accessible pages</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>the administration pages</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Experience has shown us that this lack of explicit boundaries causes a
number of maintainability problems for pre-3.3 installations:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Package interfaces were not guaranteed to be stable in any formal way, so
a change in the interface of one package would often break dependent packages
(which we would only discover through manual regression testing). In this
context, any of the following could constitute an interface change: 

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>renaming a file or directory that appears in a URL</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>changing what form variables are expected as input by a page</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>changing a procedural abstraction, e.g., a PL/SQL or Java stored
procedure or a Tcl procedure</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>changing a functional abstraction, e.g., a database view or a PL/SQL or
Java stored function</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>changing the data model</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>This last point is especially important. In most cases, changing the data
model should <emphasis>not</emphasis> affect dependent packages. Rather, the package
interface should provide a level of abstraction above the data model (as well
as the rest of the package implementation). Then, users of the package can
take advantage of implementation improvements that don&#39;t affect the
interface (e.g., faster performance from intelligent denormalization of the
data model), without having to worry that code outside the package will now
break.</para>


</listitem>

<listitem><para>A typical ACS-backed site only uses a few of the modules included in the
distribution, yet there was no well-understood way to pick only what you
needed when installing the ACS, or even to uninstall what you didn&#39;t
need, post-installation. Unwanted code had to be removed manually. 


</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Releasing a new version of the ACS was complicated, owing again to the
monolithic nature of the software. Since we released everything in the ACS
together, all threads of ACS development had to converge on a single
deadline, after which we would undertake a focused QA effort whose scale
increased in direct proportion to the expansion of the ACS codebase. 


</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>There was no standard way for developers outside of ArsDigita to extend
the ACS with their own packages. Along the same lines, ArsDigita programmers
working on client projects had no standard way to keep custom development
cleanly separated from ACS code. Consequently, upgrading an already installed
ACS was an error-prone and time-consuming process.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Consistent use of the APM format and tools will go a long way toward
solving the maintainability problems listed above. Moreover, APM is the
substrate that will enable us to establish a central package repository,
where developers will be able publish their
packages for other OpenACS users to download and install.</para>

<para>For a simple illustration of the difference between ACS without APM
(pre-3.3) and ACS with APM (3.3 and beyond), consider a hypothetical ACS
installation that uses only two of the thirty-odd modules available circa ACS
3.2 (say, bboard and e-commerce):</para>

<para>APM itself is part of a package, the <emphasis role="strong">OpenACS Kernel</emphasis>, an OpenACS
service that is the only mandatory component of an OpenACS installation.</para>

<para>The OpenACS is a platform for web-based application software, and any software

<sect2 id="apm-design-design-tradeoffs">
<title>Design Tradeoffs</title>

<para>
The design chosen for APM was meant to satisfy the following constraints: 
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The process of authoring a package must be as simple as possible.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Strict conventions must be established that provide a set of canonical
locations and names for files and patterns, for OpenACS application
development.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The processes of installing, upgrading, and using packages must be
straightforward and accessible through a web-based UI.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Package instances must be able to have subsite-specific content available
at an easily configurable URL.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>All of these requirements were met, but at the cost of development
simplicity. As <xref linkend="packages"/> demonstrates, a set of strict directory conventions are
required in order for a package to use APM. This contrasts with the apparent
simplicity available to developers of the OpenACS 3.3 system. However, while the
system has become more complex for developers to build packages, this
complexity is easily managed and is compensated for by additional
capabilities.</para>

<para>For example, to make a new application available to the system, a
developer must:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Create the necessary files to support the data model, Tcl API, and UI
pages.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Put the files in the correct locations for APM to be aware of them.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Use APM to create a new package and enable it.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Use the Site Map facility to create an instance of the package, mount it
on an appropriate URL, and set parameters for that particular instance.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>While this is complex, especially to a new OpenACS developer, the
documentation walks the developer through each of these steps. Moreover, from
following these steps, the package can be subsite specific, available to
subsites across the system, and be available for distribution to other OpenACS
installations without doing a monolithic upgrade or reinstall.</para>

<para>While the package authoring API provides a means for registering a

<para>In addition, the letters <computeroutput>d</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>a</computeroutput>, and

<para>For those who like regular expressions:</para>

 

<programlisting>

version_number := ^[0-9]+((\.[0-9]+)+((d|a|b|)[0-9]?)?)$

</programlisting>


<para>The primary use of interfaces is for other packages to specify required
interfaces, known as dependencies. A package cannot be correctly installed
unless all of its dependencies have been satisfied.</para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Specifying Configuration Parameters for each Instance</emphasis></para>

<para>A parameter is a setting that can be changed on a package instance basis.
Parameters are registered on each <computeroutput>package_key</computeroutput>, and the values
are associated with each instance. Parameters can have default values and can
be of type &#39;string&#39; or &#39;number.&#39; There is support with this
API for setting a number of minimum and maximum values for each parameter,
but for most instances, the minimum and maximum should be 1. It is useful to
allow or require multiple values for packages that need to store multiple
pieces of information under one parameter. Default values are automatically
set when instances are created, but can be changed for each instance.</para>

<title>Data Model Discussion</title>


<para>The central piece of the data model is the <computeroutput>apm_package_types</computeroutput>
table where each package is registered. When a new application or service is
installed on an OpenACS instance, a corresponding row in this table is inserted
with information about the type of package, e.g. if the <ulink url="/doc/forum">forum package</ulink> is installed on your OpenACS server, a row
in <computeroutput>apm_package_types</computeroutput> will be created, noting that it&#39;s an
application package type.</para>

<para>The <computeroutput>apm_packages</computeroutput> table is used to contain information about
the <emphasis>instances</emphasis> of packages currently created in the system. The
<computeroutput>package_key</computeroutput> column references the <computeroutput>apm_package_types</computeroutput>
table to ensure that no package instance can be created for a type that does
not exist.</para>

<para>The <computeroutput>apm_package_versions</computeroutput> table contains information specific
to a particular version of a package. Several tables reference this one to
provide further information about the particular version:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><computeroutput>apm_package_owners</computeroutput>
 Stores information about the owners of a particular version of a package.


</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><computeroutput>apm_package_dependencies</computeroutput>
 Stores information about what interfaces the package provides and
requires.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Parameter information is maintained through two tables:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><computeroutput>apm_parameters</computeroutput>
 This table contains the definition of each of the parameters for a package.

<para>The <ulink url="/acs-admin/apm">APM&#39;s user interface</ulink> is part of the
<ulink url="/acs-admin">OpenACS Administration Service</ulink>. The UI is the primary
point of contact with APM by developers and administrators. It is part of OpenACS
Administration, because only the site-wide administrator should be able to
access it. Thus in order to develop a package, the developer must be granted
site-wide administration.</para>

<para>APM has two parameters for configuring how it interacts with the UNIX
filesystem, accessible via the <ulink url="/admin/site-map/">Site Map admin</ulink>

need to be tweaked for Windows compatibility.</para>

<sect2 id="apm-design-future">
<title>Future Improvements/Areas of Likely Change</title>


<para>APM has been in production since OpenACS 3.3, and as of version 4.0 offers a
stable set of features. One major feature planned is integration with the OpenACS
Package Repository for automatic dependency satisfaction. When a user tries
to install a package that depends on other packages, the APM will contact the
package repository, determine what packages depend on it, and offer the user
a chance to download and install them all. This improvement offers value to
end users by facilitating the extension of their OpenACS systems.</para>

<para>Architecturally, minor improvements to the data model and the
specification file are planned to increase modularity. The current
implementation puts all package specification information in a single file.
This approach has certain advantages, such as centralization, but splitting
this information into several files allows for flexible extensions to the APM
architecture over time.</para>

<para>APM packages currently lack provisions to verify security information.
There are plans to add MD5 time stamps and PGP signatures to packages to
enable secure authentication of packages. These steps are necessary for APM
to be usable as a scalable method to distribute packages on multiple
repositories worldwide.</para>

<para>Another anticipated change is to split the APM UI into separate systems
for authoring, maintaining, and installing packages. The current UI presents
all of this functionality in one interface and it can be confusing from a
usability perspective.</para>
