<title>Introduction</title>


<para>The following is a requirements document for the OpenACS Package Manager
(APM), version 4.0 (APM4). APM4 offers a superset of APM v3.3 functionality
with the following specific enhancements:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>A public procedural API. (v 3.3 only has web-based UI)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support for dependency checking.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support for compound packages (to support installation chaining).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support for on-line parameter setting.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support for sub-site level configuration (requires revised parameter
and /admin pages at sub-site level; deprecation of site-wide parameter
file).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>To differentiate these new requirements from the requirements of version
3.3, all requirements new in v4 are prefaced with the number
<emphasis role="strong">4</emphasis>.</para>

<para>We gratefully acknowledge the authors of APM 3 for their original design
documentation which suggested these features, as well as the influence of the
design and open-source implementation of the Red Hat Package manager, the
Debian packaging system, and PERL&#39;s CPAN in the development of the ideas
behind this document.</para>

<title>Vision Statement</title>


<para>A typical website will tend to offer its users a number of web-based
services or applications, e.g. a bulletin board, calendaring, classified ads,
etc. A website may also have underlying subsystems, such as a permissions
system, content management system, etc. For such applications and subsystem
components, modularity - or the degree to which a component can be
encapsulated and decoupled from the rest of the system - is of great value.
Thus the OpenACS Package Manager (APM) was created to allow website components,
or packages, to be added, removed, and upgraded easily, with minimum
disturbance to the rest of the system. This allows site owners to steadily
offer users new and improved services, and also allows programmers to quickly
and easily distribute their OpenACS components in a standardized manner to other
OpenACS sites.</para>

<para>In general terms, a package is a unit of software that serves a single
well-defined purpose. The OpenACS Package Manager (APM) provides a mechanism for
packaging, installing, and configuring OpenACS software in a consistent,
user-friendly, and subsite-aware manner.</para>

<title>Use-cases and User-scenarios</title>

<para>
The APM is intended for the following classes of users, which may or may not
overlap: </para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Developers</emphasis> (referred to as &#39;the developer&#39;) use
the APM to create a software package for distribution and use the procedural
API for direct control of the APM system.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Site-wide administrators</emphasis> (referred to as &#39;the
administrator&#39;) use the APM to install packages for their OpenACS instance,
and optionally make them available to sub-sites.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Sub-site administrators</emphasis> (referred to as &#39;the
sub-admin&#39;) use an administration interface to configure and enable
packages for their sub-site.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Initial Package Development</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">David Developer</emphasis> writes a piece of software used to do
knowledge management (km) for the OpenACS. He distributes his data model,
procedure code, UI pages, and his documentation according to the APM
specification. He splits the documentation and the code into sub-packages,
and creates a KM installation-chain to install both with the APM developer
UI. Noting that his software was built with <emphasis role="strong">Patricia
Programmer</emphasis>&#39;s Super Widget toolkit, he specifies that as a
dependency. Moreover, since this package is capable of being used at the
sub-site level, David configures this option in the package. When the package
development is complete, David uses the APM developer UI to construct a
distribution file. He assigns it a version number, 1.0, and makes the package
available for download at the OpenACS package repository.</para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Initial Package Installation</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Annie Admin</emphasis> learns of David&#39;s KM system by browsing
the OpenACS package repository. Annie Admin uses the APM administrator UI
on her system. She selects to install a package from a URL and types the URL
displayed on the system. The APM automatically downloads the package. The
dependency checker notices that Patricia&#39;s Super Widget toolkit is
required, so it warns Annie of this. Annie selects an option to find a
package that satisfies the dependency at the OpenACS APM repository. The
APM informs Annie that it can download and install Jim&#39;s Super Widget
toolkit. Annie confirms this option. After successfully installing Jim&#39;s
toolkit, Annie proceeds to install David&#39;s KM system. The data model is
loaded and all of the files necessary for the software are installed. Because
installation was successful, the package is available for use.</para>

<para>Since the package is available for use, its initialization routines are
set to run automatically on server startup. Annie is warned that since there
are initialization routines, she must restart the server for the package to
be ready for use. Annie restarts the server.</para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Initial Subsite Use of Package</emphasis></para>

<para>Annie Admin decides to make the KM module available only to a particular
sub-site type on her OpenACS system, and not others. She specifies this option
using the Sub-site type UI (not part of APM).</para>

<para>Annie Admin notifies <emphasis role="strong">Sally SubAdmin</emphasis> by e-mail that a new
package is now available for use. Sally goes to her sub-site /admin page and
sees that a new entry, KM, is available. Sally clicks on it and finds links
to the installed KM documentation and to the web based configuration utility.
Then, Sally configures the package using an automatically generated web
interface and enables KM for use on her sub-site. After some initial use of
the package, Sally decides to change some parameters using the SubAdmin UI.
These changes take effect immediately, without any server restarts.</para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Upgrade Process</emphasis></para>

<para>Sally SubAdmin finds a bug in the KM system and sends a report to David
Developer. David reads the bug report and verifies that the bugs are present
in the current version. Because the bugs are present in the shared procedure
file, David assigns a watch to the file. David makes the necessary
modifications to the source code and saves the file. Because a watch was
assigned to the file, the APM automatically reloads the updated code. David
tests the program and confirms that the bug is fixed. He increments the minor
version number and makes km v 1.1 available for download at the
repository.</para>

<para>Sally SubAdmin asks Annie Administrator to upgrade the package using the
APM UI. This upgrade supersedes the old version of KM at the site-wide level.
Once Annie upgrades the package, the new version starts working immediately
in Sally&#39;s sub-site.</para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Procedural API</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis role="strong">Danielle Developer</emphasis> wants her software to perform
different actions depending on what version of another package is installed.
She uses the APM procedural API to check if KM version 1.0 is installed or
version 1.1. Based on the results of this procedural call, the software
exhibits different behavior.</para>

<title>Requirements: The Sub-Site Administrator&#39;s Interface</title>

<para>
If the developer is in charge of creating packages and the administrator for
installing them, then the sub-site administrator is responsible for
configuring and enabling packages. In order for a package to be available for
a sub-site it must be associated with the sub-site&#39;s type specification.
This interface is part of the sub-site /admin interface.

<title>Implementation notes</title>


<para>Despite the fact that requirements are meant to be design/implementation
neutral, the following thoughts were in our head when specifying these
requirements. You must be familiar with the new object design for this to be
comprehensible.</para>

<para>When a package is installed system-wide, a corresponding acs_object_type
is created for it. All parameters registered for the package are registered
for that acs_object_type.</para>

<para>When a package instance is created, it is an acs_object. Its parameters
are set using the acs_attribute_values table. The automatic web interface for
setting package parameters should be one and the same with the interface for
setting acs object attribute values. Consequently, the implementation of
these features should be quite straightforward.</para>
