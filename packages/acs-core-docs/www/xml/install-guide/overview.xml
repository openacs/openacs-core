	<title>What is OpenACS?</title>
	<para>
	  According to Philip Greenspun:
	</para>

	<para>
	  <quote>The ArsDigita Community System (ACS) is a toolkit of software
	  that will help you build Web services with a collaborative dimension,
	  ranging from knowledge management within companies to B2C ecommerce
	  to product support and community among the customers. The software is
	  free and open-source and has been tested in heavy use since
	  1995.</quote>
	</para>

	<para>
	  What's OpenACS? OpenACS was born when Don Baccus, Ben Adida,
	  et al decided to port ACS from Oracle to
	  PostgreSQL, thus making it a fully open-source solution.
	</para>

	<para>
	  OpenACS &version; is the next generation of the web toolkit. It's based on
	  ACS 4, but no longer follows ArsDigita development. Unlike both ACS
	  (which required Oracle) and OpenACS 3.x (which required PostgreSQL),
	  OpenACS &version; allows you to use either database. It's also built in such
	  a way to allow enterprising hackers (in the good sense of
	  the word) to extend it to other databases. Don Baccus leads
	  the development and numerous developers (and non-developers)
	  contribute from around the world.

	<title>Purpose of this document</title>
	<para>
	  This document will describe how to install OpenACS &version; from scratch,
	  using the source code. We will assume that you have an OS installed,
	  but we'll discuss this more in the next section. For most of this
	  guide, we will assume that you are using Linux on a PC, but we'll
	  also point you to excellent step-by-step guides for other operating
	  systems.

  <sect2 id="install-requirements" xreflabel="Requirements">
	<title>Requirements</title>
	<para>
	  You will need a PC (or equivalent) with at least these minimum
	  requirements:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Pentium processor</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>128 MB RAM

	  If you want to serve pages to people outside of your machine, you'll
	  need a network connection of some type.

	<para>
	  Note that these are minimum requirements to get a development system
	  up and running. For a production system, we recommend you read about

	  Running a reliable database-backed web server requires experience
	  with the server's environment, in this case UNIX.  UNIX is not always
	  an intuitive environment and this guide cannot hope to explain every
	  nuance.  You should be comfortable with the following tasks before
	  attempting an installation:
	</para>

	  <listitem><para> 
		  Adding users, groups, setting passwords  
		</para></listitem>

		</para></listitem> 

	  <listitem><para>

		</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	  If you've never done these things before, consider exploring UNIX in
	  greater depth before installing OpenACS.  Some useful resources for
	  doing this are described in the <xref linkend="install-resources"/>
	  section.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All of the software that you will need is free and open-source,
	  except for Oracle. You can obtain a free copy of Oracle for
	  development purposes. This is described in the <xref
	  linkend="install-oracle-getit"/> section.

	  We'll do our best to assure that following our instructions will get

		<para>
		  Keep track of the commands you are run and record their output. I
		  like to do my installations in a shell inside of emacs
		  (<computeroutput>M-x shell</computeroutput>) so that I can save
		  the output if needed. An alternative would be to use the
		  <computeroutput>script</computeroutput> command.

	  <listitem>
		<para>
		  We'll point out where the error logs for the various pieces of
		  software are. Output from those logs will help us help you. Don't
		  worry if you feel overwhelmed by all the information in the error
		  logs. Over time, you'll find that they make more and more
		  sense. Soon, you'll actually look forward to errors so that you
		  can run to the log and diagnose the problem.

		  Search the <ulink url="http://openacs.org/bboard/">bboards at

		  Ask questions at the irc channel on openprojects.net

	  <listitem>
		<para>
		  Post a question on the <ulink

		  you've done a search first. When you do post, be sure to include
		  your setup information (OS, etc) as well as the exact commands
		  that are failing with the accompanying error. If you want to post
		  stuff from your logs (please do!), be sure to enclose them in
		  &lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt; tags so that they don't get all jumbled
		  together.

    <title>Is there an easier way?</title>
    <para>

      After reading through this tome, you may ask yourself if there is a
      better way. Well, not quite. Jonathan Marsden has created RPMs (at
      <ulink
      url="http://www.xc.org/jonathan/openacs/openacs4-rpm-based-install.html">http://www.xc.org</ulink>)
      for OpenACS 4.5 but there are not yet any for version
      &version;. There has been talk about automating the install process,
      but that hasn't happened yet. Stay tuned!
