    <title>Release 5.7.0</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Made changes that extend acs-kernel's create_type and create_attribute procs,
          so they're optionally able to create sql tables and columns.  Optional metadata
          params allow for the automatic generation of foreign key references, check
          exprs, etc.

  <sect2 id="release-notes-5-6-0">
    <title>Release 5.6.0</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Added new package dependency type, "embeds".  This is a variant of the
          "extends" package dependency type added in OpenACS 5.5.0.  It allows one
          to write embeddable packages, with scripts made visible in client packages
          using URLs which include the embedded package's package key.  An example
          embeddable package might be a rewritten "attachments" package.  The current
          implementation requires a global instance be mounted, and client packages
          generate urls to that global instance.  Among other things, this leads to
          the user navigating to the top-level subsite, losing any subsite theming
          that might be associated with a community.  Using "embeds", a rewritten
          package would run in the client package's context, maintaining theming and
          automatically associating attachments with the client package.
        </para>
        <para>
          Added global package parameters - parameters can now have scope "local" or "global",
          with "local" being the default..

  <sect2 id="release-notes-5-5-0">
    <title>Release 5.5.0</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>PostgreSQL 8.3 is now fully supported, including the use of the built-in
          standard version of tsearch2.
        </para>
        <para>TinyMCE has been upgraded to 3.2.4.1 with language pack support.

        <para>acs-mail-lite now correctly implements rollout support.
        </para>
        <para>
          Added new package dependency type, "extends".  Implements a weak form of
          package inheritance (parameters and, optionally, templates).  Multiple inheritance
          is supported.  For instance, the non-core "layout-managed-subsite" extends the
          "acs-subsite" and "layout-manager" packages, resulting in a package that
          combines the semantics of both.
        </para>
        <para>
           Added new package attribute "implements-subsite-p" (default "f").  If true,
           this package may be mounted as a subsite and is expected to implement subsite
           semantics.  Typically used by packages which extend acs-subsite.
        </para>
        <para>
          Added new package attribute "inherit-templates-p" (default "t").  If true,
          the package inherits templates defined in the packages it extends.  This means
          that the package only needs to specify templates where the UI of an extended
          package is modified or extended.  This greatly reduces the need to fork base
          packages when one needs to customize it.  Rather than modify the package directly,
          use "extends" rather than "requires" then rewrite those templates you need to
          customize.
        </para>
        <para>
          Added a simple mechanism for defining subsite themes, removing the hard-wired
          choices implemented in earlier versions of OpenACS.  The default theme has been
          moved into a new package, "openacs-default-theme".  Simplifies the customization
          of the look and feel of OpenACS sites and subsites.
        </para>
        <para>
          The install xml facility has been enhanced to allow the calling of arbitrary Tcl
          procedures and includes various other enhancements written by Xarg.  Packages can
          extend the facility, too.  As an example of what can be done, the configuration of
          .LRN communities could be moved from a set of interacting parameters to a cleaner
          XML description of how to build classes and clubs, etc.
        </para>
        <para>
          Notifications now calls lang::util::localize on the message subject and body
          before sending the message out, using the recipient locale if set, the
          site-wide one if not.  This will cause message keys (entered as #....# strings)
          to be replaced with the language text for the chosen locale.

        This is OpenACS 5.0.0.  This version contains no known security, data loss, or crashing bugs, nor any bugs judged release blockers.  This version has received manual testing.

          External authenticaiton.

          Integrate with outside user databases through e.g. LDAP, RADIUS, Kerberos, MS Active Directory. 
          Imports user information through IMS Enterprise 1.1 format. Easily extended to support other 
          authentication, password management, account creation, and account import mechanisms.

          This includes improvements to the basic cookie handling, so logins can be expired without the 
          user's identity being completely lost. You can set login to expire after a certain period 
          (e.g. 8 hours, then password must be refreshed), or you can have all issues login cookies
          expired at once, e.g. if you have left a permanent login cookie on a public machine somewhere.

          User interface enhancements.

          All pages, including site-wide and subsite admin pages, will be
          templated, so they can be styled using master template and
          site-wide stylesheets.

          We have a new default-master template, which includes links to
          administration, your workspace, and login/logout, and is rendered
          using CSS.

          And there's a new community template
          (/packages/acs-subsite/www/group-master), which provides useful
          navigation to the applications and administrative UI in a
          subsite.

          In addition, there's new, simpler UI for managing members of a
          subsite, instantiating and mounting applications, setting
          permissions, parameters, etc.

          Site-wide admin as also seen the addition of a new simpler
          software install UI to replace the APM for non-developer users,
          and improved access to parameters, internationalization,
          automated testing, service contracts, etc.

          The list builder has been added for easily generating templated
          tables and lists, with features such as filtering, sorting,
          actions on multiple rows with checkboxes, etc. Most of all, it's
          fast to use, and results in consistently-looking,
          consistently-behaving, templated tables.

           The undocumented special handling of ~ and +variable+ in
           formtemplates, found in <filename>packages/acs-templating/resources/*</filename>,
           has been removed in favor of using &lt;noparse&gt; and
           \@variable\@ (the standard templating mechanisms).  Locally
           provided formtemplate styles still using these mechanisms
           will break.
