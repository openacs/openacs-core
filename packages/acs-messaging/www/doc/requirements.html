    <h3>I. Introduction</h3>

    <p>In ACS 3.x, each messaging application (e.g. bboard,
    general comments, spam, ticket tracker and so on) used its own
    specialized data model for representing and manipulating
    messages. ACS Messages provides a common data model and API for
    these applications. The service provides the following common
    mechanisms:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    A single data model for representing message objects.  Message
    objects model electronic messages between users of a collaborative
    system. Mail messages, USENET news messages, Bboard messages, user
    comments are all examples of applications that might use message
    objects.
    </li>
    <li>
    Storage of message objects.
    </li>
    <li>
    Central support for attachments, threading, and search.
    </li>
    <li>
    Mechanisms for sending and receiving message objects as e-mail.
    </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

    <p>
    Messaging applications constitute some of the most useful forms of
    web collaboration.  Many of the application packages that have
    been developed for ACS have a messaging component.  Therefore, ACS
    Messaging provides a standard set of abstractions for storing,
    sending and receiving messages through a web service. Our goal is
    to support a diverse group of messaging applications through a
    single centralized facility.
    </p>

    <h3>III. System/Application Overview</h3>
    
    <p>
    The ACS Messaging package defines a data model and API for the
    storage and retrieval of messages. While the package standarizes how
    messages are stored, applications may use any data model they want
    for higher level organization of messages into threads, forums,
    and so on. ACS Messaging places no organizational constraints on
    client applications.
    </p>

    <p>
    The package consists of the following components:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>A data model for representing and storing messages.
    <li>A data model for representing and storing attachments to messages.
    <li>A mechanism for sending messages as e-mail.
    <li>A mechanism for integrating the message store into site wide
    search.
    </ul>

    <h3>IV. Use-cases and User Scenarios</h3>

    <p>
    ACS Messaging is generally not used directly by users, so there
    are no user interface level scenarios to consider at this point.
    It's possible that in the future we will want to extend the system
    with generic administrative user interfaces, but this is not clear
    right now.
    </p>

    <P>
    We scenarios that we should consider are the kinds of applications
    that we mean to support with this package, and what the developers
    of those applications would like to see in the data model and API.
    </p>

    <p>
    The following applications in ACS 3.x could have been implemented using
    this package:

    <ul>
     <li>BBoard
     <li>Webmail
     <li>General Comments
     <li>Spam
     <li>Various parts of the ticket tracker.
    </ul>

    <p>
    Each of these applications requires a message store and each
    defines it's own high level organization for messages whithin that
    store.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Bboard organizes messages into forums and categories and
    threads. It also allows users to send and reply to messages via
    e-mail. 
    <li>
    Webmail organizes messages into mail folders.
    <li>
    General comments attaches messages to objects representing static
    or other content.
    <li>
    Spam queues messages and sends them to groups of people as e-mail.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The main requirement of the ACS Messages package is to support
    this diverse set of applications with a common
    infrastructure. This is because all of these applications would
    like the following kinds of common functionality:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Reply chaining and threading.
    <li>Messages with attachments of various types.
    <li>Representing messages as multipart MIME e-mail.
    <li>Queuing and sending messages as e-mail.
    </ul>

    <h3>VI.A Requirements: Datamodel</h3>

    <p><strong>10.0 Message Store</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    ACS Messages should provide a single store
    for objects representing messages.
    </p>

    <p><strong>20.0 Message Content</strong>
    <p>
    A message should have a primary content
    body consisting of a specified MIME type and a block of storage
    holding the content. In addition, applications may store one or
    more separate revisions of a message.
    </p>

    <p><strong>30.0 Attachments</strong> <p> Messages may be composed
    of additional attachments. Each attachment should be tagged with a
    MIME type to indicate what type of data is stored there.  Each
    attachment can only be attached to a single parent message. In
    addition, the system must be able to store one or more revisions
    of each attachment.
    </p>

    <p><strong>40.0 Unique ID</strong>
    <p>
    Messages should have universally unique identifiers to allow
    global reference and RFC-822 compliance.
    </p>

    <p><strong>50.0 Sender</strong>
    <p>
     Messages should be related to the sending
    party.
    </p>

    <p><strong>60.0 Threading</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
    The system model simple message threads, that is chains of
    messages that are replies to each other. If message M is a reply
    to some other message N, then M should be able to refer to N in a
    straightforward way.
    </p>

    <p><strong>70.0 Search</strong><p> Messages should be searchable
    as part of a site wide search. Therefore, the data model must
    integrate with the data model for site wide search.
    </p>

    <h3>VI.B Requirements: API</h3>

    <p>
    <strong>80.0 Messages</strong><p>
    The system should provide the
    following interfaces for manipulating messages:
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>80.10 Creation</strong></p> <p>Applications should be
        able to create new messages objects.
        </p>

        <p><strong>80.20 Revisions</strong></p>
        <p>Applications should be
        able to create a new revision of a given message object.
        </p>

        <p><strong>80.30 Deletion</strong> <p>Applications should be
        able to delete a message and all of its revisions and
        attachments. (is this true?).
        </p>

        <p><strong>80.40 Type Checking</strong> Applications should
        be able to check whether or not a given object is a message.
        </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>90.0 Message Attachments</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The system should provide the following interfaces for
    manipulating message attachments.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>90.10 Creation</strong> <p>Applications should be
        able to create new message attachments and connect to their
        parent object.

        <p><strong>90.20 Revisions</strong> <p>Applications should be
        able to create a new revision of a given attachment.

        <p><strong>90.30 MIME Types</strong><p>Each attachment
        should have a MIME type. The system should be able in
        principle to deal with an arbitrary collection of MIME types,
        although initial implementations may be more limited.

    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>100.0 Messages and E-Mail</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The system should provide the following interfaces for integrating
    with existing E-mail systems. Note that these requirements only
    deal with <i>sending</i> mail. Our feeling that a separate package
    should be implemented to deal with <i>receiving</i> mail that
    would use ACS Messages for storage of incoming messages.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>100.10 Sending Single Messages</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The system should provide a mechanism for specifying that a
        message should be sent as outgoing E-mail. Outgoing messages
        should be queued so that the system can maintain auditing
        information to deal with transport failures and so on.
        </p>
        <p><strong>100.20 Sending MIME Messages</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The system should be able to send messages with attachments as
        multipart MIME messages.
        </p>
        <p><strong>100.30 Sending Digests</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The system should be able to group multiple messages together
        as a single e-mail digest. For example, all the messages in a
        single bboard thread could be sent to a user as a digest.
        </p>
