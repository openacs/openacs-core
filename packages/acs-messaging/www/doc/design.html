  <h2>ACS Messaging Design</h2>
  <hr>

  ACS Messaging was born out of the design of the new bboard. One
    thing we discovered when researching requirements for bboard and
    discussion software in general was that there are a variety of
    ways one may wish to structure and organize threads of messages
    e.g. in discrete forums with tagged categories, attached to other
    user objects annotated with user ratings, etc.,.  Our design
    addressed this by separating the store of messages from the
    organizational data model and any user interfaces.<p />

    ACS Messaging is this separate layer.  Built atop the content
    repository, it provides the storage and retrieval of messages.  We
    take messages to be objects that consist of a sender (an ACS
    party), a text body, an optional reference to a parent message,
    optional file attachments, and some miscellaneous auditing data.<p />

    With these constraining set of semantics, we can
    build a library of component functionality to operate on messages.
    For example: code that displays a message, forwards a message,
    compiles a set of messages into a digest, displays a specific
    attachment, etc., This functionality can then be reused across
    messaging applications such as bboard, webmail, and general
    comments. We can maintain user preferences on HTML vs. text email,
    inline attachments vs. URLs across the system, and have simple
    procedures that do the right thing when sending email. Another
    example: if we built the IMAP server functionality 3.4 webmail
    provides against acs-messaging, then bboard forums, pages of
    comments, and webmail folders could be viewed uniformly through
    your email client. The IMAP mapping isn't quite trivial, but you
    can see the idea.<p />

    To reiterate, if applications are storing the same sort of data (a
    text-ish messages with optional attachments and replies), they
    should store them the same way. Then code from particular
    applications can possibly be refactored into generic
    functionality.<p />

    spam/general alerts/etc isn't meant to be replaced by ACS
    Messaging, at least not with what is there currently.  Currently
    it is just a store; but we intend it to be the canonical store for
    messages that need to be stored in the database. If messages are
    automatically generated from other user objects, they might need
    to be queue'd up or archived in the RDBMS.  If so this should be
    done in the acs-messaging tables.  We can implement the generic
    incoming email system by stashing messages in acs-messaging, then
    dispatching the message id to package specific code for
    processing.<p />

    Currently (11/2000), ACS Messaging is very slim; it just supports
    bboard.  We intend to add attachments (most likely implemented as
    content repository items that are children of the message),
    extensible headers (just like the webmail datamodel), and 
    versioning as provided by the content repository.<p />



  <h2>API</h2>

  ACS Messaging provides the <code>acs_messages_all</code> view as the
  primary mechanism for message queries.
 
  <blockquote><code><pre>
create or replace view acs_messages_all as
    select m.message_id, m.reply_to, o.context_id, r.title, r.publish_date,
           r.mime_type, r.content, o.creation_user
    ...
  </pre></code></blockquote>

  ACS Messaging provides the PL/SQL function acs_message.post to
  add new messages.
