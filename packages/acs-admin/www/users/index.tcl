ad_page_contract {
    by a bunch of folks including philg@mit.edu and teadams@arsdigita.com
    modified by philg on October 30, 1999 to cache the page
    (sequentially scanning through users and such was slowing it down)
    
    modified by aure@caltech.edu on February 4, 2000 to make the page more
    user friendly
    
    we define this procedure here in the file because we don't care if
    it gets reparsed; it is RDBMS load that was slowing stuff down.  We also  
    want programmers to have an easy way to edit this page.
