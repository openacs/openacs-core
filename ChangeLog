2008-01-21 05:21  gustafn

	* packages/: acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl,

2008-01-20 11:31  gustafn

	* packages/: acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl,

	  aspell or ispell programs

2008-01-20 09:21  donb

	* packages/acs-content-repository/sql/oracle/: content-package.sql,
	  content-revision.sql: Missed two files to rollback previously

2008-01-20 08:19  donb

	* packages/acs-content-repository/: sql/oracle/content-image.sql,
	  sql/oracle/packages-create.sql, tcl/content-revision-procs.tcl:
	  Rolled back abortive attempt to substitute dbms_log stuff for
	  java

2008-01-20 07:27  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/site-nodes-procs-oracle.xql: Fixed a broken
	  oracle query

2008-01-20 03:30  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/community-core-procs.tcl:
	  acs_user::flush_cache didn't flush the get_by_username memoized
	  call, causing problems if you deleted a user then tried to
	  recreate the same user, because the auth validate data (for a
	  user) code uses this proc.

2008-01-20 02:57  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/test/: navigation-procs.tcl,
	  site-nodes-test-procs.tcl: Removed the old test case #3 (and
	  renumbered the remaining ones).  The test checked that updating
	  the cache without sync'ing the children didn't change the results
	  returned by the get procedure.  However the lazy caching code by
	  Malte changed the semantics of get to automatically load the
	  cache with children if you try to get the node_id of a node with
	  kids.  This is a good thing, actually, since the update cache w/o
	  sync'ing kids exists to make the cache update quick.	But it did
	  break the test checking explicitly for the old semantics.

	  It would be nice, however, if people, after writing new code and
	  noticing that tests break, would actually sit down and determine
	  if the test or code is wrong and take appropriate action.

	  Because I just spent two full hours tracking this down and
	  verifying that the new semantics invalidate the old test code in
	  a reasonable way, and I'm not the author of the new code.

2008-01-19 12:50  donb

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-callback-procs.tcl:
	  Added an explicit blank body to two callbacks added by Malte, so
	  automated tests will pass.  This is about the third release in
	  which I've had to do this.  Simply adding "-" after the empty doc
	  comment block is sufficient, ad_proc treats that as an empty
	  body.

2008-01-19 12:36  donb

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/spellcheck-init.tcl: BSD "which"
	  doesn't return -1 if no path for the given binary exists,
	  therefore "catch" didn't, therefore (sigh) "bin" was always set
	  to aspell whether or not it exists.  Same result as the error I
	  fixed long ago with this init file (see comments) but for a
	  different reason!

2008-01-19 08:53  daveb

	* packages/acs-templating/: acs-templating.info,
	  tcl/richtext-procs.tcl: Remove support for RTE.

2008-01-19 03:11  donb

	*
	  packages/acs-authentication/tcl/test/acs-authentication-procs.tcl:
	  Running these test twice would lead to errors, due to test users
	  not being deleted.  The tear-down stuff knows how to rollback the
	  database, but caching is a bit beyond its automated capability at
	  the moment.

2008-01-17 09:18  emmar

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/image-procs.tcl: Set default
	  path for binary to /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin

2008-01-16 08:11  victorg

	* packages/acs-kernel/acs-kernel.info: Removing extra "provides"

2008-01-15 10:29  donb

	* packages/notifications/:
	  sql/oracle/notifications-package-create.sql,
	  sql/oracle/upgrade/upgrade-5.4.0d2-5.4.0d3.sql,
	  tcl/sweep-procs-oracle.xql: It's "sysdate", not "sysdate()",
	  folks :)

2008-01-14 01:35  emmar

	* etc/: config.tcl, daemontools/run: Set the default config for a
	  debian/ubuntu instalation (as agreed at the OCT)

2008-01-13 07:06  donb

	* packages/notifications/notifications.info: Fixed version number

2008-01-13 05:49  donb

	* packages/notifications/tcl/notification-procs.tcl: Broken for
	  oracle ... not now though.

2008-01-13 05:17  donb

	* packages/notifications/www/: subscribers-oracle.xql,
	  subscribers-postgresql.xql, subscribers.tcl, subscribers.xql:
	  Crap, this script was added with the following problems ...

	  1. called contacts package (fixed previously) 2. embedded PG-only
	  queries (no xql files, no attempt to make this dotlrn
	  component work with oracle despite our policy of supporting
	  oracle) 3. authorship misattributed to tracy adams (copied
	  another script as a stub),	she wasn't the source of these
	  problems

2008-01-13 03:25  donb

	*
	  packages/acs-mail-lite/sql/oracle/upgrade/upgrade-5.4.0d2-5.4.0d3.sql:
	  Fixed oracle syntax - add doesn't allow "column", unlike PG

2008-01-12 10:33  donb

	* packages/notifications/catalog/: notifications.ch_zh.utf-8.xml,
	  notifications.cs_CZ.utf-8.xml,
	  notifications.en_US.ISO-8859-1.xml,
	  notifications.es_ES.ISO-8859-1.xml,
	  notifications.zh_CN.utf-8.xml: Merged from 5.3 branch

2008-01-12 10:26  donb

	* packages/notifications/www/: manage.tcl, subscribers.tcl: Malte
	  FUCKING called his contacts package from the notifications
	  packages, causing it to break.  Of course there was no requires
	  tag in the info file so it didn't break until you actually tried
	  using a package that uses notifications.

	  And even better, there's already a proc in acs-tcl/tcl - an
	  ancient one - that does the same thing anyway.

2008-01-12 09:23  donb

	* packages/notifications/www/manage.adp: Someone changed the
	  message key here without bothering to provide a message, so I'm
	  switching back to the one that exists in something like 15 or so
	  different languages.

2008-01-12 09:14  donb

	* packages/notifications/tcl/notification-email-procs.tcl: Removed
	  some custom client code Daveb added

2008-01-12 05:45  donb

	* packages/notifications/notifications.info: This version of
	  notifications required the latest acs-mail-lite so I updated the
	  requires tag accordingly, and bumped the version number of
	  notifications to make clear that something's different.

2008-01-12 05:31  donb

	* packages/notifications/tcl/notification-email-procs.tcl: Fixed
	  typo, minor clean-up, pass reply_to as switch.  Still needs to be
	  tested.

2008-01-12 04:55  donb

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Removed these
	  two procs entirely, since a search of packages and contrib shows
	  that nothing in our tree uses them (and no package outside of
	  acs-mail-lite should've used them in the first place).

2008-01-12 04:50  donb

	* packages/notifications/tcl/notification-email-procs.tcl: Switched
	  from complex_send to send (which now includes the better features
	  of complex_send)

2008-01-11 06:16  hamiltonc

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/head-procs.tcl: updated the
	  headscript multirow with an order column to allow devs to have
	  some control over which javascript src gets loaded first

2008-01-11 05:52  emmar

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Use DCC
	  header instead of the BCC one in call to ::smtp::sendmessage

	  now)

2008-01-08 05:51  daveb

	  1. template::head::get_footer_html didn't return the html 2.
	  template::head::get_[header/footer]_html renamed to
	  template::get_[header/footer]_html because	a. makes sense

	  consistent 3. modifed blank-master to reflect #2

2008-01-08 01:29  emmar

	* www/blank-master.tcl: Added back the code to retrieve
	  body_handlers (accidently removed)

2008-01-07 11:21  daveb

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/head-procs.tcl: Fixed prioritization
	  of CSS. media=all is first.  Changed so unspecificed media goes
	  to the end. For CSS the default is all so media should always
	  have a value.

2008-01-07 09:49  daveb

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/head-procs.tcl: Initial attempt at

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/html-email-procs.tcl: Don't fail on poorly

	  complex_send, broke it down into multiple parts, refactored
	  repetitive things into foreach loops, made sure rollout support
	  is handled in complex_smtp, thopugh I have no idea how to do the

	* packages/search/www/search.tcl: fix for bug 3061

2007-02-13 21:29  carlb

	* www/blank-master.adp: adding html lang attribute so we can pass
	  WCAG P3 and getting rid of old RTE textarea to pass P2 (need to
	  warn people upgrading that they might need to add that back if
	  they are using RTE -- I added it to release notes I started in
	  the wiki on openacs.org)

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: community-core-procs.tcl,
	  community-core-procs.xql, test/acs-tcl-test-procs.tcl: Added

	  tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl, tcl/incoming-mail-procs.tcl:
	  Upgraded version to reflect it is part of core now. Added
	  incoming_object_email callback as per
	  http://openacs.org/xowiki/incoming_email. Moved incoming e-mail
	  procs to a separate file

2007-01-29 04:27  maltes

2007-01-16 15:18  donb

	* packages/acs-subsite/tcl/subsite-procs.tcl:

	  package using an autogenerated name!	This bug's been in ACS 4.x
	  since the very beginning AFAICT.

2007-01-15 11:59  gustafn

	* packages/acs-admin/tcl/apm-admin-procs.tcl: fixing code leading

2006-12-19 01:05  maltes

	* packages/acs-subsite/tcl/group-procs.tcl: Made sure the dependent
	  relations are removed as well. It might make sense I think to add
	  a delete cascade to acs_rels, but I am not entirely sure this is
	  such a wise thing, so postponing it

2006-12-18 03:23  gustafn

2006-10-29 14:48  vinodk

	* packages/acs-tcl/lib/progress-bar.adp: closing div

2006-10-29 14:02  donb

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/oracle/acs-install.sql: Main site stuff
	  was built in hard-coded english rather than using message keys
	  for the Oracle version.  Big "oops" uncovered by automated
	  testing.

2006-10-29 11:07  donb

	*
	  packages/acs-automated-testing/tcl/test/acs-automated-testing-procs.tcl:
	  If a test logs a user in it should log that user out.
	  Particularly if it then goes on to delete that user.	Failure to
	  do so screws up tests that try to access the website, logically
	  enough.

2006-10-29 06:05  maltes

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/widget-procs.tcl: Localizing the
	  group name in the party_search

2006-10-28 13:56  donb

	*
	  packages/acs-authentication/tcl/test/acs-authentication-procs.tcl:
	  Someone changed the local auth implementation to handle the
	  "RetrievePassword" operation (by e-mailing a note to the user
	  which links to a reset password page).  This is cool.  What's not
	  cool is to change the behavior without running tests on the
	  package and correcting the one that looked for the local auth
	  implementation to return "not_supported" ...

2006-10-28 13:22  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/test/multirow-test.tcl: Phew talk about
	  obscure.  This test case NEVER worked (why do people commit tests
	  that don't work in the first place????) because it used
	  ad_library rather than ad_page_contract to document the template.
	  ad_library fails in ad_make_relative_path in this case though I
	  didn't track down why in detail.

2006-10-28 12:34  maltes

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl: Added
	  apm_package_ids_from_key to get a list of all package instances

2006-10-27 13:34  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/test/ad-proc-test-procs.tcl: Fire callback
	  failed because of a callback implementation defined in the test
	  callback create callback test.  Each case would pass separately,
	  but if the create test was followed by the fire test, the fire
	  test would faile.

2006-10-27 12:38  donb

	* packages/search/sql/postgresql/syndication-create.sql: Fixed
	  constraint naming error caught by automated testing.

2006-10-26 10:20  maltes

	* etc/keepalive/: keepalive-cron.sh, keepalive.sh: Added a timeout
	  for the request in case the webserver hangs due to database
	  connections

2006-10-24 06:25  vinodk

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/test/object-test-case-procs.tcl: My bad.
	  table_name can be null on OpenACS 5.3. reverting my commit

2006-10-24 06:10  vinodk

2006-10-20 14:04  daveb

	* packages/search/: tcl/search-procs.tcl, www/search.tcl: Remove or
	  comment out dotlrn specific code snuck into search. This will be
	  a callback of some sort eventually.

2006-10-20 10:47  daveb

	* packages/acs-templating/www/scripts/xinha/attach-file.tcl: Check
	  permissions on package_id if object doesn't exist yet.

	* packages/: notifications/tcl/notification-email-procs.tcl,
	  acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Made sure that forum
	  notifications go through by adding quotes around the domain so
	  sendmessage cannot complain anymore. Just to be on the safe side
	  did this for Names of users as well in complex_send. Last but not
	  least changed complex send to only overwrite the from_string if
	  we actually find a party_id

2006-10-14 11:22  maltes

	  exists.

	  This reduces the odds of random text between hashes being

2006-07-13 10:42  donb

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/00-proc-procs.tcl: Make
	  ad_proc default to the function being public.  This decision was
	  made by Don and Dave and a couple of others during the current
	  bugbash.

	  Why not TIP it?  There's no semantic meaning to the switch, and
	  ad_proc doesn't require you to declare a procedure to be either
	  -public or -private.	This was enforced in an automated test, but
	  if we WERE to insist on it, ad_proc should cause failure to
	  declare a proc public or private and error.  That would be too
	  harsh (would break a lot of client code, too).  Assuming
	  functions are public by default seems reasonable.  The only
	  effect is to change the behavior of the API browser if you've
	  chosen private or public viewing modes.

2006-06-03 12:58  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/lib/email.tcl: Added support to 'to_addr'
	  if we do not provide recipient_ids

2006-06-02 17:09  donb

	* packages/search/tcl/search-procs.tcl: Someone modified this file
	  and committed it without even bothering to see if it would
	  compile without errror ...

2006-06-02 16:28  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/acs-tcl.info: Tagged acs-tcl HEAD as 5.3.0d1
	  because contacts needs 5.2.3b3 or better

2006-06-01 06:04  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: The name of
	  the user should be in paranthesis when sending an e-mail

2006-05-31 07:16  daveb

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/oracle/acs-metadata-create.sql: Remove
	  duplicate "default" in package definition.

2006-05-31 07:16  daveb

	*
	  packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/test/content-item-test-procs.tcl:
	  Fix typo in test procs.

2006-05-31 06:42  daveb

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/: content-item-procs.tcl,
	  content-revision-procs-oracle.xql,
	  content-revision-procs-postgresql.xql,
	  content-revision-procs.tcl, content-revision-procs.xql,
	  test/content-item-test-procs.tcl, test/test.html: Add
	  -tmp_filename parameter to content::item::new and
	  content::revision::new to handle file uploads at a low level with
	  the cr tcl api. You still need to figure out the mime type and
	  cotent type (image,etc.) before calling content::item::new. A
	  convenience wrapper should be written if you need that feature.
	  (that would replace cr_import_content, it think.)

2006-05-28 00:14  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Minot change

2006-05-21 06:14  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/: lib/email.tcl,
	  tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Enabled support for party_ids also
	  containing groups

2006-05-21 00:54  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Added group
	  sending support

2006-05-20 13:56  donb

	* etc/config.tcl: Changed db pool config to keep handles open
	  forever rather than a billion seconds.  A billion seconds from
	  mid-May 2006 is 2038, so folks were running into the Unix Y2.038K
	  bug a few decades early.  That billion number was originally
	  picked because 0 (keep open forever) didn't work in earlier
	  versions of AOLserver.  Early versions of the Oracle client
	  interface on Linux used to hang when the handle was closed, thus
	  the need to keep them open "forever".  Turns out it's a good idea
	  anyway if the db library and the appropriate db driver for
	  AOLserver don't leak memory.	Both PG and Oracle have been
	  well-behaved in this respect, so we just keep the db handles open
	  indefinitely by default.

2006-05-17 06:59  vinodk

	* packages/acs-automated-testing/tcl/aa-test-procs.tcl:
	  aa_export_vars takes a list of arguments

2006-05-14 23:36  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/: acs-mail-lite.info,
	  tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Upgraded version to be on the save
	  side for dependencies. FIxed boolean logic mistake

2006-05-14 09:12  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/: acs-mail-lite-callback-procs.tcl,
	  acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Support for using party_ids instead of
	  email addresses with complex_send. Upgraded callback

2006-05-13 04:23  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/: acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl,
	  acs-mail-lite-procs.xql: move to using smtp for complex_send.
	  Support for single_mail flag. Support for bcc and cc emails

2006-05-13 04:23  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/lib/email.tcl: Support for fixed_sender

2006-05-11 06:50  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Added support
	  to send files from the filesystem instead of cr_items to
	  complex_send

2006-05-03 03:41  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/: acs-mail-lite.info, lib/email.tcl: Added
	  support for including files in e-mail sending from a predefined
	  folder. This is useful if you want to have the option to include
	  some marketing or legal documents in most of your e-mails

2006-05-02 02:44  leed

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/00-proc-procs.tcl: Fixed a
	  problem in callbacks; implementations always call the contract

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/test/acs-tcl-test-procs.tcl: Conditionalized
	  tests of bindvar emulation so they're not run for Oracle.  Two of
	  them don't work for Oracle (tries to do a "select" in

	  adheres to them or not :)

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/parse-procs.tcl: Parse level wasn't

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.xql: Oops,
	  yesterday's commit was partially bogus, tested these queries at

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.xql: Replaced two
	  slow queries using cc_users with their faster equivalent using
	  parties and users.  Makes a huge difference on Oracle when there
	  are many, many users (49,000 in this case).  And yes, I checked,
	  the original queries used indexes galore, Oracle was doing as
	  well as can be expected.

2005-07-06 02:42  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Using the
	  hostname is considerable better than using ad_url. Just in case
	  we strip out "http://" in case someone accidently set the
	  hostname with an http:// in front (not sure if AOLserver would
	  allow this in the first place, but the devil is in the details).

2005-07-05 11:49  maltes

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: ad_url is
	  supposed to work even if ns_hostname resolves to a non existing
	  domain for whatever the reason

2005-06-29 06:39  jeffd

	  upgrade callback the asm registration parameter

2005-06-10 07:54  maltes

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs.tcl: Interesting side
	  effect as acs-lang is loaded after acs-tcl. lang::util::localize
	  was unknown, so I had to add a check to the db_list_of_lists
	  procedure to test if the string is actually a message key before
	  localizing it. Now install works.

2005-06-10 07:49  daveb

	  More I18N. Added a new procedure relation:get_objects that

	  multiple relationsships of one type (e.g. on company usually has
	  multiple employees)

2005-06-09 23:51  maltes

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs.tcl: Added the ability to
	  localize the return of db_list_of_lists. This is something I
	  should have done already way back before I changed

	  rules....

	  for items and revisions

2005-06-06 23:52  maltes

	* packages/acs-lang/acs-lang.info: Added requirement for
	  acs-translations due to new I18N procedure (not utterly
	  necessary, as you could always provide a different package key
	  and you do not need the package per se, just when you want to
	  export your message keys, but I think it is still better this
	  way)

2005-06-06 23:49  maltes

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/lang-util-procs.tcl: Added procedure to
	  transform a string into an I18N version of itself (so it can be

2005-06-05 12:41  maltes

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/lang-util-procs.tcl: Added procedure to
	  convert messages in #message_key# syntax to something that can be
	  used in select boxes. This is necessary due to the fact thatwe
	  are storing message_keys e.g. with "pretty_name" directly in the
	  database.

2005-06-04 16:00  jader

	  duplicate version of the 11arg content_folder__new

	  content_folder__copy did not preserve context_id properly

	  content_item__copy2 had a bunch of unused varaibles -- removed
	  them.

	  content_item__copy now preserves live_revision so things which
	  copy an item with a live revision to not have to explicitly
	  publish the new copy (which eg file storage did not do).

	  content_revision__copy did an insert into acs_objects without
	  specifying column names which breaks on a new install since the
	  order is not as expected.

	* packages/acs-content-repository/sql/oracle/content-folder.sql:
	  This is just a comment on the previous commit.  Oracle was
	  refusing to compile the package because the specification and
	  body were not declaring the type in an identical way.  The
	  specification says that the package_id column is of type
	  acs_objects.package_id%TYPE but the body previously was declaring
	  it cr_folders.package_id%TYPE.  That wasn't good enough for
	  Oracle.  Now the two are declaring the type the same way.

	* bin/pg_7.2to7.3_upgrade_helper.pl: Sanity checks and usage
	  output. Streams replacement data through now and doesn't require
	  as much RAM as the size of the dump file. Improved regexps so
	  that more (hopefully all) identifiers are found.

2004-08-27 02:40  gyang

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/filter-procs.tcl: Changed
	  item::get_live/best_revision in content::init to use
	  ::item::get_live/best_revision.  The reason is that bcms
	  introduces ::content::init, which requires a keyword argument
	  -item_id, and this new proc is then accidentally  called by
	  content::init because it's in the ::content namespace.

2004-07-28 13:23  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/upgrade.xml: Rewrote
	  part of the upgrade files section: removing the option to import
	  from a tarball (because packages are no longer included, so it
	  doesn't help people upgrade packages, and because the entire

	  explained things a bit more.

	  includelet to correctly build return_url

2004-05-14 07:10  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/oracle.xml: Added
	  link to Oracle on Linux FAQ that publically lists certified Linux
	  distros for Oracle.

2004-05-14 06:28  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/: maintenance.xml,
	  oracle.xml: added Dirk's notes and new links on Oracle perf and
	  certified setup

2004-05-14 05:52  dirkg

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/oracle.xml: Added
	  useful links, statspack and autotrace installation instructions
	  etc. Needs to be worked over, revised and reviewed by Joel.

2004-05-14 03:59  jeffd

	* packages/acs-templating/resources/lists/table.adp: add the title
	  for sorting to the currently sorted by column, set sort graphic
	  alt to empty (title already on the text link), remove a class
	  list where not needed

2004-05-14 03:54  jeffd

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/text-html-procs.tcl: add some output to help
	  diagnose error in ad_parse_html_attributes_upvar

2004-05-14 03:17  jeffd

	* packages/search/: search.info,
	  sql/postgresql/search-packages-create.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/upgrade/upgrade-5.2.0d1-5.2.0d2.sql,
	  tcl/search-procs-oracle.xql, tcl/search-procs.tcl,
	  tcl/search-procs.xql: Put functions into a search:: namespace and

	  specific xql files.  unset datasource when finished with it.
	  bump to 5.2.0d2 + postgresql upgrade script.

2004-05-13 13:24  jader

	*
	  packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/developers-guide/tutorial-advanced.xml:
	  The categories section was duplicated twice, with the second one
	  not coming through correctly because there was not an id= tag for
	  it. I took out the second one. I think that's the correct one to
	  take out. Also, the section on hierarchical queries did not have
	  an id attribute, so I added it in.

2004-05-13 12:47  jader

	* packages/acs-templating/www/resources/forms.css: Internet
	  Explorer does not left align the widgets by default, which gives
	  it a behavior at odds with all the other browsers I've tested on
	  (Safari, Mozilla, etc). This is a small change that left aligns
	  widgets by default in all forms, which looks much better,
	  especially on larger forms.

2004-05-11 00:58  joela

	* packages/acs-lang/: lib/change-locale-bar.tcl,
	  www/change-locale-include.tcl: removed page_contract from
	  includelet so it works when included in another page with a
	  conflicting contract; improved logic for when to show list of
	  locales

2004-05-10 14:42  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/upgrade.xml: Fixed
	  spelling mistake, last commit incorrectly put my fix on the 'cd'
	  line instead of the cvs line. (thanks for catching this, Jeff)

2004-05-10 10:59  joela

	* www/site-master.adp:	changed template to use new locale switcher

2004-05-10 10:58  joela

	  catalog/acs-lang.es_ES.ISO-8859-1.xml, lib/change-locale-bar.adp,

	  a few translations to enable testing

2004-05-09 08:33  joela

	* packages/search/search.info: incremented version number so that
	  catalog gets loaded

2004-05-09 08:32  joela

	* packages/search/: catalog/search.en_US.ISO-8859-1.xml,
	  lib/search.adp, lib/search.tcl: added search includelet;
	  internationalized it.  depends on acs-kernel.common_search, which
	  is on the translation server and should be in 5.1.1

2004-05-09 07:57  joela

	* packages/acs-lang/: catalog/acs-lang.en_US.ISO-8859-1.xml,
	  www/change-locale-include.tcl, www/index.adp, www/locale-set.tcl,

2004-05-09 06:48  joela

	* packages/acs-lang/www/: change-locale-include.tcl,
	  change-locale-include.xql: localized the list of locales in
	  Change Locale dialog

2004-05-07 15:10  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/upgrade.xml: The tip
	  syntax for cvs was wrong

2004-05-07 10:29  jeffd

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/www/doc/index.html: messed up html tag in
	  main doc page

2004-05-07 09:49  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/upgrade.xml: Added
	  in -kk to the cvs checkout, which prevents tons of conflicts in
	  CVS

2004-05-07 08:17  jeffd

	* www/blank-master.tcl: only include the developer support css if
	  ds_show_p true

2004-05-07 05:22  jeffd

	* packages/acs-templating/resources/lists/list.adp: 1. don't
	  include javascript (now comes from core.js I think).

	  2. don't create the form unless there are bulk actions

	  3. remove spurious table tags.

	  4. make the list row container a div rather than a P tag.

	  5. change the class name for the list row container to    be
	  "list-row odd" and "list-row even" rather than simply list-row

	  6. Include the list_properties.bulk_action_export_chunk if there
	  are bulk actions.

	  7. Add the outermost div which has class list_properties.class

2004-05-07 04:31  jeffd

	* www/blank-master.tcl: don't add an empty onload element to the
	  body tag

2004-05-06 19:33  carlb

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/os.xml: added aspell
	  to the list of optional software

2004-05-06 17:27  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/upgrade.xml: Updated
	  the cvs section to 5.1. Also changed one CVS command. It would
	  import the entire openacs-4 cvs tree into your local cvs tree,
	  which is unnecessary and annoying.

2004-05-06 14:38  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/: acs-templating.info,
	  tcl/richtext-procs.tcl: Added a check for the browser's
	  User-Agent header before using htmlArea - Default to use htmlArea
	  for richtext widgets

2004-05-06 06:01  peterm

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/: item-procs-oracle.xql,
	  item-procs-postgresql.xql, item-procs.tcl: adding the
	  item::delete PL/SQL wrapper proc

2004-05-06 05:57  peterm

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/: folder-procs-oracle.xql,
	  folder-procs-postgresql.xql, folder-procs.tcl: Adding
	  folder::delete proc which is a start in having a Tcl wrapper API
	  for the content folder PL/SQL functions like we already have for
	  items

2004-05-06 05:37  jeffd

	* packages/acs-api-browser/www/content-page-view.adp: can't use
	  regular adp variable interpolation since when displaying source
	  you don't want to translate tags, you want to display the 'real
	  source'

2004-05-05 11:36  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/upgrade.xml: Added a
	  comment that after the upgrade, you may need to change the
	  parameters of acs-kernel so that you can allow HREF and IMG tags.

2004-05-05 05:36  joela

	  keepalive time out its request to the db test page after 6
	  seconds. Reducing number of tries to 6. Making it possible to run

	  restart a server more often than every 10 minutes

2004-04-27 06:30  nimam

	  acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl, acs-tcl/tcl/apm-xml-procs.tcl:
	  Adding new package version attributes maturity, license, and
	  license_url. Introducing the concept of dynamic package version
	  attributes so that these can be added easily in the future. The
	  attributes are driven by a metadata spec returned by the proc
	  apm::package_version::attributes::get_spec.The attributes are
	  stored in the skinny table apm_package_version_attr and managed
	  through the Tcl API in namespace
	  apm::package_version::attributes. Changing the parse and generate
	  info XML file procs to use the dynamic attributes. Adding the
	  dynamic attributes to the manifest XML file as well. The
	  attributes are editable in the APM admin UI.

2004-04-25 02:32  donb

	* etc/install/functions.sh: Applied Vinod Kurup's patch 491 for bug
	  1724 - functions.sh failed if you weren't using daemontools

2004-04-16 12:03  donb

	* packages/notifications/tcl/interval-procs.xql: Geraldo Morales
	  noticed that this proc's query hardwired "instant" rather than
	  using the "name" parameter as it obviously should ...

2004-04-16 05:59  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/files/openacs.txt: stripped the

	  from init.d

2004-04-15 13:10  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/other-software.xml:

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/developers-guide/permissions.xml:

2004-04-07 10:03  jader

	*

2004-04-06 12:50  andrewg

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/oracle/apm-create.sql: Removing
	  acs_objects_package_id_fk constraint, which was breaking the
	  install.  We can put it back in and have things work if we first
	  rearrange the code in apm_package.new to perform the insert into
	  apm_packages before the update on acs_objects.  But for now we'll
	  do as the PG version does, which is to not define the constraint
	  at all.

2004-04-05 13:36  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/acs-templating.info: Documentation ofr
	  RefreshCache parameter

2004-04-05 09:34  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/tcl-documentation-procs.tcl: - Added -form
	  switch to ad_page_contract to let callers pass in a form ns_set
	  specifically. This is useful when using ad_page_contract to
	  validate includelets - Removed unused -type switch to
	  ad_page_contract - This is a merge of the 1.18.4.1 change on
	  dotkul branch

2004-04-05 07:25  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/variables.ent: variables for
	  HEAD/5.2

2004-04-01 15:05  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/aolserver4.xml:
	  Added clarification that you'll need to edit nsd-postgres or
	  nsd-oracle script with path to Aolserver if you're not using
	  /usr/local/aolserver as the Aolserver directory.

2004-04-01 14:51  jader

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/aolserver4.xml:

	  test/acs-automated-testing-procs.tcl: adding a simple example
	  tclwebtest test case that creates a test user and logs him in

	  order to do this I copied over some procs from etc/install/tcl to
	  tclwebtest-procs.tcl. The procs in etc/install/tcl should go away
	  as we have tclwebtest fully integrated in acs-automated-testing

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/date-procs.tcl: Rolling back the

	  to 1.27.

2004-03-26 01:05  bdolicki

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/date-procs.tcl: Part of this commit
	  is fixing #1176 (just a few acs-lang strings and properly
	  splitting the file into *-proc.tcl and *-init.tcl part).  Part of
	  this fix (catalog file) was accidentally commited before by Joel

	  The bigger part is changing load order of library files so that
	  acs-lang-init.tcl gets loaded before all other *-init.tcl files.

	  This is necessary because acs-lang is so fundamental and it is
	  quite possible (as we have seen with the example of
	  date-init.tcl) that there are *-init.tcl files that need
	  translated strings.

	  Fixed bug 1516 ... though there are other regexps that bear

	  legal Tcl source.  So I just fixed this one regexp looking for
	  spaces where spaces might not be in the source.

2004-03-06 17:00  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/lib/: ad-return-complaint.adp, complain.adp:
	  Lars changed ad_page_contract to call the "complain" template
	  rather than spit out HTML directly.  However he used a multirow,
	  and while this is nice, it ain't what "complain" took.  I moved
	  "complain" to "ad-return-complaint" (to match the name of the Tcl
	  proc that calls it) ... and created a new "complain" that does
	  the multirow thing.  "ad_return_complaint" is begging for
	  retirement as it assumes you have an "<li>" in each error list
	  element if there's more than one of them and also forces you to
	  pass the number of error messages.

	  That's why I created a new template rather than rewrite
	  ad_return_complaint to stuff the error list into a multirow (my
	  "complain" template, used by "ad_page_contract", does the <li>
	  tags itself - something a site designer can change, the whole
	  point of templating this).

	  Fixing this query.

2004-03-04 20:21  marka

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/resources/site-master.css: added clear:
	  left; to the style for breadcrumb.  The requirement is only
	  apparent in mozilla - since the font sizing etc there makes the
	  sitename text sit a little lower, the lhs of the breadcrumb would
	  alignt with the rhs of the sitename. note that the design
	  requires it in all css implementations to be correct, and it will
	  do no harm...

2004-03-04 10:41  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/: acs-templating.info,
	  tcl/richtext-procs.tcl: Added support for htmlArea to richtext
	  widget. Controlled by the UseHtmlAreaForRichtextP parameter,
	  which currently defaults to 'false', because the user doesn't
	  have a way to turn it off yet, and it doesn't work in all
	  browsers.

	* packages/acs-subsite/tcl/relation-procs.tcl: Fix bug when

	  creating the user will already make them a member of the main
	  site, by checking to see if a relation already exists before

	  it will still insert the extra admin_rel relation, if you're
	  chose to make the user an admin.

2004-02-19 01:37  lars

	*
	  packages/acs-content-repository/sql/postgresql/content-folder.sql:
	  We still want security_inherit_p to default to 't', otherwise
	  bcms::folder::create_folder breaks, because null is not a valid

	* packages/acs-content-repository/: acs-content-repository.info,
	  sql/postgresql/content-create.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/upgrade/upgrade-5.0.0-5.1.0d1.sql: Fix for bug
	  where tree_sortkey would start from zero for each parent that
	  wasn't a cr_item (since parent_id's foreign key constraint is on
	  acs_objects, not cr_items). Now all non-cr_item-parent-ids are
	  treated as one big pool of 'null' parent_id's, allowing you to
	  create as many logical roots as you darn well please. I would
	  appreciate review from the OCT on this patch (and am going to
	  solicit one by email).

2004-02-18 01:55  lars

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/filter-procs.tcl: Wrapping
	  if's in curly braces

2004-02-17 07:36  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/form-processing-procs.tcl: Fix for bug
	  introduced by Don's 1.45 on_validation_error patch: Now we would
	  enter the on/after_submit-new/edit_data blocks, even if the form
	  was refreshing.

2004-02-17 07:32  donb

	* packages/acs-content-repository/sql/postgresql/:
	  content-extlink.sql, content-folder.sql, content-item.sql,
	  content-keyword.sql, content-symlink.sql, content-template.sql,
	  content-type.sql: PG 7.3 doesn't support 'current_timestamp' as a
	  literal any more (it still is defined as a variable, of course).
	  Also define_function_args assumes NULL as the default value if
	  none is specified, 'null' <> NULL ...

2004-02-17 07:21  lars

	* packages/acs-authentication/tcl/test/sync-test-procs.tcl:
	  Should've been more thorough. Turns out every single test case
	  was registered with backslash-space on the first line, causing an
	  error

2004-02-17 07:10  lars

	*
	  packages/acs-content-repository/sql/postgresql/content-folder.sql:
	  Fixed bug with default values for creating folders; default
	  values in define_function_args are literal strings, not
	  expressions, so security_inherit_p;null is treated as the literal
	  string 'null', and so is creation_date;current_timestamp treated
	  as the literal string 'current_timestamp', which is not a valid
	  timestamp format. There are probably other similar bugs
	  introduced, we just fixed the ones that were blocking us.
	  Emailing OCT about this.

2004-02-17 06:50  lars

	* packages/acs-authentication/tcl/test/sync-test-procs.tcl: Fixed
	  broken case: space after backslash

2004-02-16 15:00  jader

2004-02-16 07:28  maltes

	* packages/acs-lang/www/admin/: message-list-postgresql.xql,

	  ...

2004-02-11 09:15  lars

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/build-repository.tcl: Forgot to turn

2004-02-11 09:15  lars

	  "-on_validation_error" block that can be used to set the page
	  title etc after a validation error (request blocks aren't
	  executed in this case, and using ad_form_new_p explicitly has its
	  own problems).

2004-02-10 04:16  joela

	* packages/acs-templating/www/doc/: developer-guide.html,
	  index.html: removed obsolete appendix

2004-02-09 05:44  bdolicki

	  packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/developers-guide/tutorial-advanced.xml:

2004-02-09 05:35  bdolicki

	  packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/developers-guide/tutorial-advanced.xml:
	  Becoming compliant with Timo's switch rename

2004-02-08 10:39  lars

	  Templated context bar

2004-02-08 10:38  lars

	* www/: default-master.adp, default-master.tcl: Use templated
	  context bar

2004-02-08 10:37  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/navigation-procs.tcl: Added new
	  ad_context_bar_multirow, which gets the context bar as a
	  multirow, so we can render it using the templating system rather
	  than Tcl

2004-02-08 10:36  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/memoize-procs.tcl: Marking procs
	  public/private

2004-02-08 09:36  lars

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/subsite-add.tcl: Adding creator of
	  the subsite to the subsite group: This hadn't been changed to fit
	  the new data model which requires the user to have both a
	  membership_rel and an admin_rel, so only the admin_rel was
	  created

2004-02-08 09:35  lars

	* packages/acs-subsite/tcl/group-procs.tcl: Allow adding members to
	  groups without doing permissions check -- useful when adding the
	  creator of a group to the group

2004-02-08 09:22  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl: - Improved doc for
	  ad_returnredirect - Removed remaining ref to -abort_p on
	  ad_returnredirect.

2004-02-08 09:20  lars

	* packages/acs-subsite/: lib/login.tcl, www/register/index.adp,
	  www/register/index.tcl: Use user-message for expired login

2004-02-08 09:20  lars

2004-02-07 14:25  lars

	  (and has been for 3+ years)

2004-02-07 03:47  maltes

	  in content_folder copy.

2004-02-06 12:02  donb

	* packages/acs-content-repository/: acs-content-repository.info,
	  sql/postgresql/content-extlink.sql,

	  sql/postgresql/content-item.sql,

	  sql/postgresql/content-revision.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/content-symlink.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/content-template.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/content-type.sql: Added define_function_arg calls
	  to non-content-revision objects and to create_type and
	  create_attributes, so we can do these operations via Tcl.
	  Content revisions, due to LOB/non-LOB issues and the
	  incompatibility of LOB operations between DBs need their own
	  "smart" Tcl API.

2004-02-06 10:55  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/index.html: fixed chapter numbering
	  via new docbooks-xsl

2004-02-06 04:36  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: text-html-procs.tcl,
	  test/html-conversion-procs.tcl: - Fixed bug: default for
	  ad_html_text_convert was set to truncate at 70 chars - The
	  algorith in util_close_html_tags for including ellipsis in
	  determining when to break was flawed -- caused it to break too
	  son

2004-02-05 15:38  jong

	* packages/acs-reference/acs-reference.info: bumped version # and
	  added automount

2004-02-05 15:36  jong

	  version

2004-02-05 15:36  jong

	* packages/acs-reference/www/view-one-reference.tcl: removed inline
	  sql

2004-02-05 15:34  jong

	  fixed context bar

2004-02-05 09:05  lars

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/:

	  Fixed a bug: we used to prefetch item_id, which gets discarded
	  and then grab a new one in the proc.	Now we are relying on the
	  caller to provide item_id prefetched on the form.  (This of
	  course sucks donkeyballs but at least it is not broken now).

	  Also using a character entity instead of $ in $Id$ to prevent
	  keyword expansion.

2003-12-29 12:08  dirkg

	* packages/: acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/document-procs.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/request-processor-procs.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl,
	  acs-templating/tcl/filter-procs.tcl,
	  acs-templating/tcl/query-procs.tcl,
	  acs-templating/www/doc/demo/error.tcl,
	  acs-templating/www/doc/demo/implicit_escape.adp: all TCL's clock
	  clicks always with the -milliseconds option. The TCL manual
	  explicitly states that without this switch the return result is
	  platform dependant. The OpenACS code works at the millisecond
	  granulartiy and silently assumes that 1 millisecond equals 1000
	  clicks which is not necessarily true.

	  I used this shell script to automatize the replacing:

	  #!/bin/bash

	  for file in `grep -lsr "\[clock clicks\]"
	  /web/openacs-head/packages/ `; do   echo "repairing $file"   sed
	  "s/\[clock clicks\]/\[clock clicks -milliseconds\]/g" $file >
	  fout	 mv fout $file done

	  And then grepped for

	  grep -r "expr.*clock clicks" /web/openacs-head/packages/

	  to manually remove the divisions by 1000.

2003-12-24 15:57  donb

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/installer/index.tcl: Improved
	  the detection of the port on which we're running, so the default
	  form value on the installation info page is set correctly.  For
	  my beta version of AOLserver, at least, ns_conn port is not
	  reliable.  And unlike the documentation's claim, ns_info port is
	  not supported.  The code now checks nssock and defaults to
	  ns_conn port rather than use ns_conn port exclusively.

2003-12-22 14:03  lars

	  fail

2003-12-18 04:25  lars

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/users/new.tcl: Hack to make page

2003-12-17 12:21  lars

	  edit/display modes don't work

2003-10-10 04:35  lars

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/: oracle/acs-install.sql,
	  postgresql/acs-install.sql: Fixed bug #657: Create admin rel
	  segment for main site

2003-10-10 03:40  frankn

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/members/index.tcl: Small change to
	  www/members/index.tcl, which allows non-registered visitors to
	  see a partial email address. Assuming they are permitted to see
	  the members list in the first place, of course.

2003-10-10 03:32  lars

	* packages/ref-timezones/ref-timezones.info: Forgot to set
	  initial-install, I thought it actually resolved the dependencies,
	  but alas ...

	* packages/acs-subsite/tcl/subsite-procs.tcl: Fix my own bug. My
	  check for admin priviledges in tcl/subsite-procs.tcl was out of
	  context and didn't work.

2003-10-10 02:02  frankn

	* packages/acs-subsite/: acs-subsite.info, tcl/subsite-procs.tcl,
	  www/group-master.tcl, www/index.adp, www/index.tcl,
	  www/members/index.adp, www/members/index.tcl: Resolves bug #851.
	  Added two new parameters, MembersCanInviteMembersP and
	  ShowMembersListTo, and made the subsite pages and Tcl procs
	  honour them.	In particular subsite::get_section_info{}.

2003-10-10 01:23  peterm

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/: widget-procs-oracle.xql,
	  widget-procs-postgresql.xql: making party_search widget queries
	  do a lower() on the search_string

2003-10-10 01:20  peterm

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/permissions/grant.tcl: making permission
	  grant page use tcl procs and removing two xql files no longer
	  needed

2003-10-10 01:03  lars

	* packages/acs-lang/acs-lang.info: FIxed bug #914: Require

	  adding message keys lost during export from translation server

2003-10-09 08:42  frankn

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/site-map/instance-delete.tcl: This
	  fixes a problem with deleting an unmounted package instance.	If
	  you added and mounted, say, a subsite instance, unmounted and
	  then attempted to delete it through sitemap->Manage unmounted
	  applications, you would get an error. It seems
	  site_node::get_node_id_from_object_id doesn't even fail for an
	  unmounted package, returning the empty string in this case, and
	  the catch test doesn't trip. Now we explicitly test for the
	  node_id being set to a sensible value.

	  acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl: fixing problem that I
	  introduced earlier with ctl files not being loaded when package
	  is installed from install.xml file and the the proc
	  apm_packages_full_install. The problem was that no data model
	  files were provided and the proc apm_data_model_scripts_find was
	  used to provide the default. However, that proc would not return
	  ctl files. I therefore changed it to do so and removed the proc
	  apm_ctl_files_find that we no longer need

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/install-guide/other-software.xml:

	  Christensen

2003-07-19 17:42  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl: I sped up the code
	  Peter Marklund wrote to automatically resolve package
	  dependencies (so you don't need to check off every package you
	  need) by, oh, a couple of orders of magnitude for large
	  dependency lists.

	  This code could be cleaned up a *log* and probably made faster as
	  a result but I'm satisified with this speed-up for now.

2003-07-15 17:06  donb

	* packages/ref-timezones/sql/: oracle/00-timezones.ctl,
	  oracle/01-timezone-rules.ctl, postgresql/00-timezones.ctl,
	  postgresql/01-timezone-rules.ctl,

	  sql/common/*sql files weren't being displayed by the APM, are now
	  3. added index on start_date in timespan-create after user

	  made it possible to let content_template.new(), and its PG
	  equivalent, create a revision of the template by simply providing
	  the template in the 'text' param.  2. Bug-fixed content::init,
	  content::get_content and some other procs related to the
	  index.vuh in the CR. Virtual URLs are now more or less supported
	  for items of any content type if they have a content template
	  associated with them.  If a content item associates a template to
	  it (by registering it), it will have precedence over the type's
	  template. It will transparently act as a default, in other words.

2003-07-07 05:00  olah

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: 00-database-procs.tcl,

2003-07-04 14:18  donb

	* packages/notifications/tcl/: sweep-procs-oracle.xql,

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/request-processor-procs.tcl: Munged previous
	  change a bit so that we try to serve the file normally if it

2003-07-03 16:02  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: request-processor-init.tcl,
	  request-processor-procs.tcl: Added a new filter
	  "rp_resources_filter" that triggers on URLs that begin with
	  "/resources".  The filter simply ns_returnfile's the file,
	  avoiding all the bullshit overhead associated with return files
	  that must be permission checked.

2003-07-02 10:57  olah

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/site-map/: parameter-set-2.tcl,

2003-07-01 05:32  olah

2003-06-28 02:24  olah

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/release-notes.html: Fixed:

	  > missing link to
	  http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4-6-2/files/analog-dev.cfg.txt
	  > http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4-6-2/individual-programs.html

	  Removed the link altogether - removed all links to files actually
	  in the tarball

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  all the docbook

	  Using symlink in openacs.xsl

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  In qmail section, link to download page for ucspi and qmail

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  >Which is the best keyword for "your service name?" in the docs.
	  It should be
	  >easily recognized as a placeholder, easy to search-replace, and
	  should
	  >be generic enough that most users can leave it unchanged.
	  Currently we use
	  >"service0", which meets the last two of the three requirements.
	  >Earlier docs used "birdnotes," which met the first two
	  requirements.

	  Decided I didn't care

	  Added comment to instructions

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  > Add text about which version of PostgreSQL works to top of that
	    section.

	  added.

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  >First, in http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4-6-2/postgres.html the
	  make
	  >install didn't work for me when I used postgres so I had to use

	  Could not repro.

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  > Second, in the [postgres.html] doc, in point 8 for Red Hat, why
	  is
	  > there chmod 700 for the script? All the other scripts in
	  > /etc/rc.d/init.d are 755.

	  Changed to 755.

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  >Optimizing Postgres:
	  >should optimize kernel settings for Postgres
	  >http://developer.postgresql.org/docs/postgres/kernel-resources.html

	  Added postgres tuning instructions

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  >For compiling nsopenssl, this was necessary on Debian:

	  >apt-get install libssl-dev
	  >make OPENSSL=/usr/lib/ssl

	  >nsopenssl needs 0.9.6 or newer. Debian stable currently runs
	  openssl
	  >0.9.6c

	  Added note.
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  >If you are on Oracle, you have to su - oracle, then su to root
	  to get
	  >your environment right. Otherwise, nsoracle won't compile.

	  Added note.

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  >The web user wasn't added in the Oracle install step, so I added
	  it

	  Already mentioned in the doc.

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  >For some reason, the include and sample-config.tcl files were

	  owned by remadmin in reference platform.  Seems harmless so
	  didn't add anything to instructions.

	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  >bin and lib were group owned by staff. I changed that to root as
	  well:

	  Changed default suggestion to --analyze (once per day) to be
	  conservative due to forum thread about full analyze affecting
	  performance due to locking

	  between versions 1.19.2.12 and 1.19.2.13. The change would break
	  some application and the proc export_vars is not supposed to do
	  HTML quoting. To have & HTML quoted as &amp; you need to invoke
	  ad_quotehtml. On cvs head we will make the templating system

	  apm_get_watchable_files and apm_cancel_all_watches and cleaning
	  up the watch API a little

2003-04-04 00:04  peterm

	* packages/acs-automated-testing/tcl/: aa-test-init.tcl,
	  aa-test-procs.tcl: adding the aa_run_with_teardown proc for
	  guaranteed teardown in test cases. Moving nsv initialization to a
	  new \-init.tcl file where it belongs

2003-04-03 23:10  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/index.tcl: language fix: committed an
	  incomplete sentence in last commit

2003-04-03 23:08  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/index.tcl: removing incorrect help
	  statement trying to explain what an installed package is

2003-04-03 09:04  peterm

	* packages/notifications/notifications.info: fixing version number
	  inconsistencies in info file for version 0.5. Somebody forgot to
	  bump up the number in all places

2003-04-03 06:55  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/acs-admin.info: correcting version url that
	  wasn't updated which broke Jarkko's upgrade

2003-04-03 02:44  peterm

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/site-map/unmounted.tcl: fixing
	  HTML typo (i tag instead of li tag)

2003-04-03 02:40  peterm

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/site-map/unmounted.tcl: Correcting
	  text - singletons are not necessarily unmountable. Adding
	  javascript confirm box to deletion of packages. Adding if_no_rows
	  comment to both db_foreach statements.

2003-04-03 01:24  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-file-procs.tcl: making the new proc
	  apm_file_watchable_p check its path argument more strictly

2003-04-02 08:06  peterm

	* packages/acs-automated-testing/: tcl/aa-test-procs.tcl,
	  www/admin/init-file-resource.tcl, www/admin/testcase.adp,
	  www/admin/testcase.tcl: adding a link for re-sourcing a test init
	  file on the testcase page so you don't have to restart the server
	  when the test code has changed. We have been putting test case
	  definitions in test_procs files and I think they should be moved
	  to test_init files instead. The convention should be that procs
	  files only contain ad_proc statements and only init files execute
	  code.

2003-04-02 08:02  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/file-watch.tcl: clarifying in
	  ad_page_contract documentation that paths to file-watch page are
	  relative to package root, not server root

2003-04-02 07:58  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/: file-watch.tcl, version-files.tcl:
	  changing the version-files page to use the new
	  apm_file_watchable_p proc. Passing the path relative to server
	  root to apm_file_watch proc.

2003-04-02 07:56  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-file-procs.tcl, apm-install-procs.tcl,
	  apm-procs.tcl, site-nodes-procs.tcl: improving argument handling
	  of apm_package_instance_new proc. Adding proc
	  apm_file_watchable_p proc that determines if a file is
	  appropriate to watch.

2003-04-02 05:48  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-install-procs.tcl, apm-procs.tcl,
	  site-nodes-procs.tcl: commenting behaviour of
	  site_node::instantiate_and_mount and apm_package_instance_new
	  when the package is a singleton and an instance already exists

2003-04-02 02:10  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/index.tcl: adding a view files link
	  for each package (there used to be such a link and a count). Made
	  showing all packages the default (this is what at least I want
	  99% of the time and I'm assuming other developers will have
	  similar needs)

2003-03-31 09:21  peterm

	*
	  packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/40-db-query-dispatcher-procs.tcl:
	  making the query *NOT* compatible error message more informative
	  by logging the db version of the query as well as the system db
	  version

2003-03-31 06:45  tilmanns

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/site-map/parameter-set.tcl:
	  Cosmetic improvement: only display the warning about parameters
	  set in config files when there are such parameters set.

2003-03-31 05:23  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/index.tcl: disabling watches on the
	  APM index page in performance mode and providing a link to the
	  parameter page

2003-03-31 04:59  peterm

	  from oacs-4-6 branch (-j 1.11.2.4)

2003-03-30 12:31  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/developers-guide/tutorial.xml:
	  added tutorial - most is at second draft level of quality; debug,
	  automated testing, and advanced topics are mostly incomplete

2003-03-29 22:04  joela

	* packages/acs-core-docs/www/: mac-installation.html,
	  upgrade-4.5-to-4.6.html, upgrade.html: updated backup/recovery

2003-03-27 02:46  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/packages-install-4.tcl: adding a
	  restart server link after package installation. People (including
	  myself) used to forget restarting the server which was
	  frustrating

2003-03-26 07:51  lars

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/file-watch.tcl: Merged bug fix to file
	  watching over from head

2003-03-21 06:57  donb

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/oracle/: acs-permissions-create.sql,
	  groups-body-create.sql, rel-segments-body-create.sql,
	  rel-segments-create.sql: Accidently dropped the latest PG rather
	  than Oracle versions of these files here.

	  magic args var in db_list_of_ns_sets

	  main site can read the images (previously you had to grant read
	  privs to "/doc" explicitly to get the graphics stored by
	  acs-datetime to show up.

2003-03-10 12:13  peterm

	* packages/acs-api-browser/www/: package-view.adp,

2003-03-10 11:59  peterm

	  acs-admin/www/apm/version-generate-tarball.tcl,

	  needed now that file listings are not stored in info files and
	  db. I may not find time to do this change on the 4.6 branch, but
	  the change as it's just removal of dead code.

2003-03-10 11:29  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-xml-procs.tcl, apm-xml-procs.xql:
	  changing to no longer read/write file listings and database
	  support from/to info files. This info is now determined directly
	  from the paths in the file system (see procs
	  apm_get_package_files and apm_package_supports_rdbms_p)

	  apm-install-procs.tcl, apm-xml-procs.tcl,
	  tcl-documentation-procs.tcl: Deprecating apm_version_file_list

	  db_package_supports_rdbms_p (use apm_package_supports_rdbms_p
	  instead). Removing debug printouts

2003-03-10 11:10  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl: making

	  db. Making apm_load_libraries be based on apm_get_package_files
	  for consistency

2003-03-10 06:18  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/packages-install.tcl: replacing use of

2003-03-10 06:04  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/30-apm-load-procs.tcl:
	  tightening up regexp for create and drop scripts even more than
	  Don did previously. Adding apm_package_supports_rdbms_p that
	  examines db type of files in file system to determine support.
	  Tightening up regexp for apm_guess_db_type so that only sql, xql,
	  and tcl files have a db type.

2003-03-10 04:23  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/version-reload.tcl: changing the

	  would be fairly expensive (maybe as much as a second for many
	  packages)

2003-02-28 05:19  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/parse-procs.tcl: When searching for

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/lang-catalog-procs.tcl: chaing catalog
	  import proc so that import for uninstalled packages is not an
	  upgrade, also if the version number in the catalog file is lower
	  than that of the package it's not an upgrade

2003-02-25 09:10  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/version-files.tcl: removing pages and
	  xql files that are no longer needed no that file paths of APM
	  packages are not in db

2003-02-25 08:59  peterm

	* packages/acs-automated-testing/www/admin/index-oracle.xql:
	  changing Oracle version from 8.1.7 to 8.1.6 as the query
	  dispatcher will ignore queries with version number above 8.1.6

	  www/apm/packages-install-3.tcl, www/apm/packages-install-4.tcl,
	  www/apm/version-files.tcl, www/apm/version-i18n.adp: Changed the
	  file manage page of the APM to reflect that file paths are no
	  longer in the database. The page now just serves the purpose of
	  showing the file types that the APM thinks your files are and
	  watching files. Making paths to sql files and catalog files be
	  fetched directly from the filesystem. Offering to mount
	  applications under /package_key upon install for convenience.
	  Making sure the package-delete page works by unmounting and
	  uninstantiating packages with the Tcl API (to trigger callbacks)
	  before uninstall. Adding ability to watch all files in a package.
	  Minor update of I18N instructions

2003-02-25 08:47  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/: 10-utilities-procs.tcl,
	  30-apm-load-procs.tcl: adding the apm_get_package_files proc for
	  fetching files of certain types of a package. The idea is to rely
	  on the filesystem rather than the info files/db for file
	  listings. Made the install more verbose again for packages as I
	  wanted to see why my installation didn't work. We could use the
	  apm_dummy_callback if we make sure that as soon as there is an
	  error inoformation is presented to the user. It is also good to
	  show progress during installation

	  tcl/apm-procs.tcl: Adding the before-upgrade and after-upgrade
	  callback types. To go along with the upgrade callbacks Lars added
	  the excellent apm_upgrade_logic proc that lets you specify
	  arbitrary pieces of Tcl code to be executed on upgrade from
	  version X to version Y. The proc figures out which upgrade code
	  chunks to source and in which order (with the same logic as with
	  the traditional upgrade sql scripts). Making paths to sql files
	  (create, drop, upgrade) and catalog files (I18N) be fetched
	  directly from the filesystem rather than from the info file. The
	  file listings in the info files and in the database are now AFAIK
	  superfluous and have no influence on the system. Adding proc
	  apm_watch_all_files for watching all files in a package. Bumping
	  up version name from 4.5 to 4.7.2d

2003-02-25 08:00  peterm

	  tags with <ul><li> ... stuff which is better digestable by
	  browsers and fixes bug #223, and removed empty link to old
	  release notes

2003-02-11 03:05  peterm

	* packages/acs-automated-testing/: tcl/aa-test-procs-oracle.xql,
	  tcl/aa-test-procs.tcl, www/admin/testcase-oracle.xql: changing
	  Oracle version of xql files to be 8.1.6 so that the query
	  dispatcher will accept them. Truncating test notes if they are
	  too long for the column in db. Removing inline query in tcl file

2003-02-11 02:28  lars

	* packages/acs-content-repository/sql/postgresql/content-type.sql:
	  Added check for table name longer than 25 chars, because that
	  caused me significant pain to track this problem down.

2003-02-10 09:37  lars

	* packages/acs-content-repository/sql/: oracle/content-create.sql,
	  postgresql/content-create.sql: Adding new mime-types, which I
	  forgot to add back when I added the new richtext widget. Jeff
	  will probably go in and rename them something else for me, and
	  hopefully he'll propagate the change to the richtext widget and
	  acs-tcl/tcl/text-html-procs as well.

2003-02-10 06:29  lars

	* packages/acs-automated-testing/www/admin/testcase.adp: Added
	  coloring to alternate rows.

2003-02-09 14:30  peterm

	* packages/: acs-admin/www/apm/version-callback-add-edit.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl: added a check that Tcl callback procs
	  specified in the APM UI have correct argument lists

2003-02-08 12:31  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/navigation-procs.tcl: merging fixing and
	  caching of context bar logic that was committed on 4.6 branch
	  (versions 1.7 to 1.7.2.2) onto trunk

2003-02-08 12:03  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/sql/: oracle/upgrade/upgrade-4.7d4-4.7d5.sql,
	  postgresql/upgrade/upgrade-4.7d4-4.7d5.sql: the upgrade to
	  acs-lang 4.7d5 would break if server already had swedish locale,
	  added check to fix that

2003-02-08 10:54  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/: acs-lang.info,
	  sql/oracle/upgrade/upgrade-4.7d4-4.7d5.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/upgrade/upgrade-4.7d4-4.7d5.sql: upgrade of
	  acs-lang 4.7d4-4.7d5 adding locales from the translation server

2003-02-08 08:25  jeffd

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: request-processor-procs.tcl,
	  request-processor-procs.xql: peter neglected to fix the query
	  name in the .xql file for the host-node_id map query

2003-02-07 19:15  peterm

	* packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/host-node-map/delete.tcl: closing
	  bug #208 caching lookup of host_node_map. My experiments with
	  host node map suggest that it's not overly useful (a lot of
	  broken links). At least now this feature doesn't add overhead to
	  each request.

2003-02-07 19:10  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/request-processor-procs.tcl: closing bug
	  #208 caching lookup of host_node_map. My experiments with host
	  node map suggest that it's not overly useful (a lot of broken
	  links). At least now this feature doesn't add overhead to each

2003-02-06 16:14  peterm

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/util-procs.tcl: adding a level switch
	  to multirow_to_list proc

2003-02-06 01:36  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/index.tcl: Adding a link to the secret
	  Cache Control page so that people can find it

2003-02-04 00:50  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/text-html-procs.tcl: Removed log statements
	  that had accidentally been left in.

2003-02-03 06:38  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/form-processing-procs.tcl: Added support for
	  search_query, cancel_url, has_edit, actions

2003-02-03 05:56  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl: adding new proc
	  exists_and_equal

2003-02-03 04:17  lars

	* packages/acs-service-contract/: acs-service-contract.info,
	  tcl/acs-service-contract-procs.tcl,

	  tcl/implementation-procs.tcl, tcl/msg-type-procs-oracle.xql,
	  tcl/msg-type-procs-postgresql.xql, tcl/msg-type-procs.tcl: Added
	  Tcl API for defining contracts and registering implementations

2003-01-31 09:00  peterm

	* packages/: acs-admin/www/apm/package-delete-2.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl, acs-tcl/tcl/site-nodes-procs.tcl:
	  adding before-uninstall, before-uninstantiate, and before-unmount
	  Tcl callbacks for packages

2003-01-31 08:30  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/: bootstrap.tcl, installer.tcl:
	  moving the mounting of core packages from the bootstrapper to the
	  installer. To enable this I am setting up a more complete Tcl
	  environment before installation of those packages by sourcing
	  procs in acs-subsite and certain init files in acs-tcl as well as
	  redefining ad_conn. This also means that core packages have a
	  more complete environment when/if they use post-instantiation
	  procs.

2003-01-31 08:17  peterm

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/: oracle/acs-install.sql,
	  postgresql/acs-install.sql: acs-install.sql doesn't need to
	  instantiate acs-kernel as this is done during install of that
	  package (since it's a singleton)

2003-01-31 08:16  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl: changing the comment
	  of apm_mount_core_packages reflecting where it's now called and
	  what I've learned (painfully) about the installer

2003-01-31 06:01  peterm

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/: oracle/apm-create.sql,
	  postgresql/apm-create.sql: Adding missing piece to the db upgrade
	  of acs-kernel 4.6.1-4.7d - the callbacks were not being copied
	  when upgrading a package through the edit package page. Changing
	  to create or replace syntax for functions in PG (works in 7.2 and
	  7.1 is deprecated)

2003-01-31 05:12  lars

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/: version-callback-add-edit.tcl,
	  version-callbacks.adp, version-callbacks.tcl: Fixed callback UI

2003-01-31 04:23  lars

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/: file-watch.tcl, index.tcl,
	  version-reload.tcl, version-view.tcl: - Took out extra call to
	  apm_package_load status - allowed calling file-watch with more
	  than one file_id - offer a 'watch all above files' link when
	  reloading a package - restructured the version-view page to
	  display links more logically

2003-01-31 00:37  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/acs-kernel-procs.tcl: correcting mistake in
	  last commit. ad_verify_install should still check for the
	  presence of an admin.

2003-01-31 00:34  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl: Correcting
	  apm_package_install proc. It should only instantiate, mount, and
	  invoke after-install callback after an initial install, not after
	  an upgrade. We'll add an after-upgrade callback as well when we
	  need that.

2003-01-30 14:51  jeffd

	* tcl/zz-postload.tcl: merge fix for bug 193 to HEAD

2003-01-30 08:28  danw

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/postgresql/acs-permissions-create.sql:
	  Modified permissions code to materialize
	  acs_privilege_descendant_map view.  Needed to speed up queries on
	  acs_object_grantee_priv_map view.

2003-01-30 08:12  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/acs-kernel-procs.tcl: As part of moving
	  mounting of core packages from installer to bootstrapper I forgot
	  to commit these changes to ad_verify_install. The proc should no
	  longer check that acs-admin is mounted.

2003-01-30 06:08  peterm

	* packages/: acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl,
	  acs-kernel/sql/postgresql/acs-install.sql,
	  acs-kernel/sql/oracle/acs-install.sql,
	  acs-bootstrap-installer/bootstrap.tcl,
	  acs-bootstrap-installer/installer/index.tcl: moving instantiation
	  and mounting of all core packages (acs-lang, acs-admin, api-doc
	  etc.) except acs-kernel and main site (retained because they are
	  needed during install) from the acs-install.sql file to the Tcl
	  proc apm_mount_core_packages that is invoked on first startup.
	  Note that this unfortunately means that callbacks will not be
	  invoked for the main site node and for the acs-kernel instance.

2003-01-30 02:27  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl: fix: shouldn't pass
	  the upgrade switch to apm_load_catalog_files when we are
	  installing for the first time

2003-01-30 01:33  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/localization-data-init.tcl: adding russian
	  date-time localization data, provided by Vadim Makarov

2003-01-30 01:03  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/localization-data-init.tcl: adding polish
	  date-time localization data, provided by Marcin Kuczkowski

2003-01-29 08:12  peterm

	* packages/notifications/notifications.info: making notifications
	  and attachments use the auto-mount feature

2003-01-29 08:08  peterm

	* packages/acs-subsite/: acs-subsite.info, tcl/subsite-procs.tcl:
	  changing acs-subsite to use an after-mount callback instead of
	  the old post_instantiation proc. Replacing call to
	  site_node_mount_application (deprecated) with
	  site_node::instantiate_and_mount

2003-01-29 07:53  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/: package-add-2.tcl, package-add.tcl,
	  packages-install-4.tcl, version-callback-add-edit.adp,
	  version-callback-add-edit.tcl, version-callback-delete.tcl,
	  version-callbacks.adp, version-callbacks.tcl, version-edit-2.tcl,
	  version-edit.tcl, version-edit.xql, version-view.tcl,
	  version-view.xql: adding editing of auto-mount and Tcl callbacks
	  to the APM UI

2003-01-29 07:50  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/acs-permissions-procs.tcl: adding missing
	  return statement in permission_p

2003-01-29 07:48  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/test/acs-tcl-test-procs.tcl: adding unit
	  test for auto-mount feature

2003-01-29 07:45  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-install-procs-oracle.xql,
	  apm-install-procs-postgresql.xql, apm-install-procs.tcl:
	  deprecating apm_package_instantiate_and_mount. Adding
	  auto-mounting of packages to the apm_package_install proc.
	  Removing a few inline queries that are not used.

2003-01-29 07:41  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-procs-oracle.xql,
	  apm-procs-postgresql.xql, apm-procs.tcl, apm-procs.xql: making
	  apm_package_instance_new the canonical proc for instantiating a
	  package. Deprecating the create_package proc. Adding
	  apm_mark_packages_for_bootstrap that will is used to schedule all
	  necessary files for reload after a set of applications have been
	  installed. Extracting apm_mark_files_for_reload from
	  apm_mark_version_for_reload so that the functionality of
	  scheduling files for reload could be reused.

2003-01-29 07:37  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: site-node-apm-integration-procs.tcl,
	  site-nodes-procs.tcl: adding canonical proc for instantiating and
	  mounting a package: site_node::instantiate_and_mount.
	  Deprecatating old procs with this functionality and making them
	  invoke the new proc. Adding after-mount callback invocation in
	  site_node::mount. Adding warn flag to a few deprecated site-node
	  related procs.

2003-01-29 07:33  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-file-procs.tcl: making
	  apm_version_file_list take a path_prefix argument

2003-01-29 07:17  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/00-proc-procs.tcl: issuing a
	  debug level warning when deprecated procs with the warn flag are
	  invoked

2003-01-29 01:43  peterm

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/: oracle/apm-create.sql,
	  postgresql/apm-create.sql: as part of the sql upgrade of
	  acs-kernel from 4.6.1 to 4.7d I forgot to change views and plsql
	  code. Adding these changes now to make the upgrade complete

2003-01-27 13:19  donb

	* packages/: acs-content-repository/tcl/content-procs.tcl,
	  acs-lang/tcl/lang-catalog-procs.tcl,
	  acs-lang/tcl/lang-util-procs.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs-oracle.tcl,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs-postgresql.tcl: Switched to "file
	  copy" ...

2003-01-27 08:42  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/richtext-procs.tcl: Removed the
	  underline button, and made it return an empty value when contents
	  is unset, so that 'required' fires (thanks to Ola).

2003-01-27 07:35  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/richtext-procs.tcl: Fixed typo with $
	  instead of # in comment Made richtext buttons not participate in
	  tab order

2003-01-27 07:29  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/form-processing-procs.tcl: Added cancel_url
	  documentation.

2003-01-27 06:12  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/text-html-procs.tcl: Removed extra -- in
	  call to ad_enhanced_text_to_plain_text.

2003-01-27 05:55  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/: richtext-procs.tcl,
	  widget-procs.tcl: Added richtext widget and datatype, as
	  mentioned on the bboard thread about rich input

2003-01-27 05:49  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/text-html-procs.tcl: Added new formats
	  text/enhanced and text/fixed-width to ad_html_text_convert, and
	  improved significantly on the automatic HTML rendering
	  functionality (line breaks, links)

2003-01-27 04:30  peterm

	*
	  packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/40-db-query-dispatcher-procs.tcl:
	  when an xql query is not loaded because of too high version
	  number in the xql file - issue an error message in the log file

2003-01-27 02:45  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-xml-procs.tcl: adding code to read/write

	* packages/acs-kernel/: acs-kernel.info, sql/oracle/apm-create.sql,
	  sql/postgresql/apm-create.sql: upgrading acs-kernel from 4.6.1 to
	  4.7d to support APM auto mounting of packages, and Tcl procedure
	  package callbacks such as after-install, after-instantiate, and
	  after-mount. Upgrade scripts supplied to add table
	  apm_package_callbacks and add column auto_mount to table
	  apm_package_versions.

2003-01-27 02:30  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/text-html-procs.tcl: Fixed bug:
	  util_close_html_tags would actually insert the end tag even
	  though it had discarded the open tag, e.g. if you said <form>,
	  you'd get </FORM>!

2003-01-26 22:02  rmello

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/00-proc-procs.tcl: Merging
	  changes from oacs-4-6

2003-01-24 14:16  jeffd

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/oracle/upgrade/upgrade-4.2-4.2.1.sql: An
	  upgrade script from almost 2 years ago is patched. yay. closes
	  bug 180

2003-01-24 08:02  lars

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: request-processor-init.tcl,
	  request-processor-procs.tcl, request-processor-procs.xql: Fixed
	  caching of ad_acs_kernel_id, which didn't work properly

2003-01-24 05:03  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/localization-data-init.tcl: adding missing

	  acs-admin/www/apm/version-dependency-add-2.tcl,
	  acs-admin/www/apm/version-edit-2.tcl: Adding code so that a
	  package always provides the service of itself (package_key and
	  version_name) when created. When a package is upgraded the
	  provided version_name is automatically updated. Also making the
	  info file be automatically updated upon edit of the package

2003-01-23 09:55  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-install-procs.tcl,
	  apm-install-procs.xql, apm-procs.tcl, apm-procs.xql,
	  apm-xml-procs.tcl, apm-xml-procs.xql,
	  site-node-apm-integration-procs.tcl, site-nodes-procs.tcl,
	  test/acs-tcl-test-procs.tcl: adding support for Tcl proc package
	  callbacks. Currently only supporting after-install and
	  after-instantiate callbacks (next up is after-mount). There is no
	  UI yet.

2003-01-23 09:46  peterm

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/: oracle/apm-create.sql,
	  postgresql/apm-create.sql: adding a table to the APM for holding
	  Tcl proc callbacks invoked after installation, instantiation etc.
	  of packages

2003-01-23 03:24  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-install-procs-oracle.xql,
	  apm-install-procs-postgresql.xql, apm-install-procs.tcl: Fixing
	  APM dependency bug. When installing new packages, the version
	  comparison among the packages to install would use a simple Tcl
	  comparison rather than the version_name_greater plsql proc (i.e.
	  version 0.1a would be considered less than 0.1d). I changed to
	  use the plsql proc instead

2003-01-23 03:06  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/lang-message-procs.tcl: backing out a
	  change I made by mistake from the translation server. The
	  lang::audit::created_message is a proc that is used only on that
	  server and I have no plans yet to add it to cvs

2003-01-22 11:11  rmello

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/tcl/00-proc-procs.tcl: - Merge
	  ad_proc documentation improvements to HEAD.

2003-01-22 10:39  daveb

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/: package-delete-2.tcl,
	  package-delete.tcl: Added checkbox option to delete package files
	  instead of automatically removing them frm the filesystem.

2003-01-22 10:36  daveb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-install-procs.tcl: Added -remove_files
	  boolean switch to apm_package_delete to optionally remove files
	  fromt he filesystem.

2003-01-22 07:29  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/: bootstrap.tcl,
	  tcl/30-apm-load-procs.tcl: making sure the acs-tcl test procs are
	  source after the Tcl libraries of acs-automated-testing are
	  sourced

2003-01-22 07:26  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl: adding the proc
	  apm_supported_callback_types for the new package callbacks.
	  Making apm_load_packages take arguments to make it optional to
	  source libraries and queries (only load tests, needed for
	  acs-tcl)

2003-01-22 07:25  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl: with help from Jeff and
	  Lars making the util_sets_equal_p proc do the right thing

2003-01-21 13:37  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/: lang-catalog-procs.tcl,
	  lang-catalog-procs.xql: setting upgrade status for a message key
	  to deleted if the en_US message is deleted. This is unfortunately
	  another example in the I18N code where we are assuming the
	  presence of the en_US locale and that translation is done from
	  this locale.

2003-01-14 04:18  peterm

	* packages/acs-admin/www/apm/packages-install-4.tcl: changing

	  installation as is done in bootstrap.tcl

2003-01-14 04:17  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-file-procs.tcl, apm-install-procs.tcl,

2003-01-13 14:55  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-file-procs.tcl, apm-install-procs.tcl,
	  apm-procs.tcl: making sure catalog messages are cached when new
	  package is installed in APM. Also making sure tcl libraries and
	  xql queries are loaded for the package after installation so that
	  restart of server is no longer necessary (I hope). Resorted to
	  using the force_install_p flag since the tcl libraries wouldn't
	  source otherwise in the apm_files_load proc. This doesn't feel
	  like the ideal solution but it gets the job done

2003-01-13 14:51  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/: lang-message-procs.tcl,
	  lang-message-procs.xql: making it possible to cache all catalog

2003-01-13 12:23  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/bootstrap.tcl: refactoring:
	  extracting the code in the boostrap file that loads a package
	  into the proc apm_load_package. Would like to call this proc
	  after package installation in the APM.

2003-01-13 11:53  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl: apm_load_package should not
	  cache that package is enabled

2003-01-13 11:48  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/apm-procs.tcl: adding a procedure
	  apm_load_package for loading a package so that this can be done
	  without restarting the server, for example directly after
	  installation. Moving Ben's comment for apm_load_queries into
	  ad_proc

2003-01-13 11:22  peterm

	* packages/acs-bootstrap-installer/bootstrap.tcl: the check for

2003-01-13 11:18  peterm

2003-01-13 11:14  peterm

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: apm-procs.tcl, apm-procs.xql: removing

	  If 'display', all fields are grayed out, and the pretty value is
	  displayed instead of the internal value (e.g. the label of the
	  element of a list).  - support multiple buttons on the form. Used
	  for the 'Edit' button, but can be used for other buttons as well.
	  - Fixed all the standard templates to include the new buttons
	  and to use the <label> tag.  - Added an example to the
	  documentation showing how this new display/edit mode looks.

	  there's no object mounted here, fall back on the old package_id
	  of the subsite through which you're currently mounting the new
	  package.

2002-12-13 04:30  peterm

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/: lang-catalog-procs.tcl,
	  lang-message-procs.tcl: I18N: loading the catalog files from the

2002-09-15 13:48  lars

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/: data-procs.tcl, widget-procs.tcl:

	* www/default-master.adp: In order for the Bug Tracker version bar
	  to work I added the possibility for a package to stick something
	  at the beginning of the HTML body. This is a temporary
	  workaround. It may not work well with sites with customized
	  default-masters. The Bug Tracker should show its version

	  introduced by Arjun's change of tab processing: Tab characters
	  was part of Branimir's sTaRtUrL hack. Since the tabs got replaced
	  with spaces, the sTaRtUrL/eNdUrL things didn't get replaced back.
	  I've moved the tab expansion to the end of the proc, and that
	  takes care of the problem. In addition, I've added quotes, single
	  and double, to the list of characters that we strip from the end
	  of a URL.

	* packages/notifications/tcl/: notification-procs-oracle.xql,
	  notification-procs-postgresql.xql, notification-procs.xql: The
	  insert statement included a sysdate, yet it was in the common

	  and changed it to now() for postgresql.

2002-08-01 05:55  lars

	* packages/notifications/tcl/sweep-procs-postgresql.xql: Missing
	  columns in query. These were in the Oracle query, and at least

	  line

2002-08-01 02:31  lars

	* packages/search/tcl/search-procs-oracle.xql: Changed the
	  -oracle.xql file to claim that it's designed for Oracle, not
	  PostgreSQL. I'm guessing that Yon meant to target 8.1.6 like most
	  of the rest of OpenACS, but I may be wrong.

	  db_register_pooled_sequence)

	  a bug reported by Andrew Grumet (in the forums) - the default
	  parameter value could be returned at times even if a value was
	  set.	 This happened if you added a parameter because the cache
	  update query was wrong.  Rebooting would fix it so no one had
	  noticed ...

2002-07-26 06:57  lars

	* packages/acs-admin/www/users/: user-add-2.tcl, user-add-2.xql:
	  Moved double-click check up before we create the user, so we
	  don't get the annoying error message in the error log. Also, got
	  rid of the  from the error we spit out if something does go
	  wrong, since this variable is not defined, so we'd get a database
	  error, then an internal server error.

2002-07-26 06:56  lars

	  -move flag to cr_create_content_file since most common use of
	  this command is to take an uploaded file from /tmp and put it
	  into the cr and for many machines /tmp is the same partition as

	* www/default-master.tcl: Adding site-specifc-master fuctionality.
	  This allows a site to modify the look of the entire site by
	  adding a tcl/adp pair named "site-specific-master" and setting
	  the "UseSiteSpecificMaster" ad_param of the parent acs-subsite
	  package. The param defaults to "false".

	  Why not just edit the "default-master" files? Well, if you break
	  default master much of the site will be broken. This feature
	  allows you to experiment with the site-specific-master with the
	  knoledge that with the flip of a parameter the pristine
	  "default-master" will be used. And there's no risk for committers
	  to check in their custom site-specific-master files into the tree
	  unlike with editing def-master.

	  was already done by the    party.new() func but at least one
	  update missed this).	Got rid of all	  "lower(email) = " and
	  "upper(email) = " checks and just made all use the	db email
	  column directly and lower-cased Tcl vars.  In this way the index
	    on the email column is always and consistently used without
	  needing to	define functional indexes on the column (an EE
	  feature for Oracle).

	  4. Rationalized naming of a couple of workflows and fixed a
	  glossary PG bug    where apparently its workflow got overwritten
	  by one from the CMS at some	 point in time.

	  5. Made the .cmp/.dat/.frm filters in the template code usable
	  though not	very beautiful nor exactly correct.  But with
	  practice you can use them    to debug pages in the packages/*
	  hierarchy.  I also turned these off by    default as there's no
	  need to run these filters on a production site!

	  6. Performed minor surgery on templating, including adding a new
	    "ad_return_exception_template" that allows you to return a
	  templated    error page and aborts the script.

	  7. ??? probably but I think this covers most stuff.

	  1. Added session-update.tcl, a small utility which somewhat
	  safely allows    you to put up a link that changes a
	  session_property, for instance to    change the number of items
	  displayed or that sort of thing.  The caller	  must sign their
	  values and URL, which are verified by the callee via
	  ad_page_contract.  If the referrer doesn't match the signed
	  expected    referrer, you get bounced.  I think this is
	  reasonably secure (though    permissions should always be
	  rigorously checked on all pages, of course)

	  2. acs_events had an html_p flag in the datamodel but no way to
	  set it.     Fixed.  It should really be a mime-type but since
	  it's not using the	 CR, and since I'm extremely busy with
	  other stuff, I didn't fix it.

	  3. While doing #1 above I learned that signing and verifying
	  arrays didn't    quite work.	Fixed.

	  4. Found and fixed a small problem with my earlier work on the
	  currency widget.

	* packages/acs-templating/: acs-templating.info,
	  tcl/data-procs.tcl, tcl/date-procs.tcl, tcl/widget-procs.tcl:
	  I fixed the currency datatype and did a little other mumbo-jumbo
	  stuff.  I did this on another installation of OpenACS 4 (dotLRN,
	  to tell the truth) and just mass-copied the files over to make
	  sure I didn't miss anything.

	  Not the best idea now that I think about it ...

2002-01-18 16:47  arjun

	* www/default-master.adp: reverted to 1.1 code becase of my
	  accidental commit

2002-01-18 16:44  arjun

2002-01-17 15:00  arjun

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs.tcl: Added -append flag to
	  db_multirow. Works like the "template::multirow append" command.
	  EX:

	  So in the templates query interface you do:

	  template::multirow create ...  template::multirow append ...

	  Now you do:

	  db_multirow foovar ...  (first or only multirow) db_multirow
	  -append foovar ...

	  Setting of new array variables is supported in the code block on
	  the db_multirow command using "set foovar(new_array_var) "value""
	  syntax

	* packages/:
	  acs-content-repository/sql/postgresql/content-create.sql,
	  acs-subsite/www/pvt/home.tcl, acs-tcl/tcl/defs-procs.tcl:
	  1. home.tcl - applied patch from SDM to use ad_pvt_home rather
	  than a    fixed value.

	  2. defs-procs.tcl - applied patch that fixed a "link within a
	  link" problem.

	  3. content_item.tree_sortkey had no index (gulp!)

2002-01-15 08:40  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs.tcl:
	  Added a "-local" switch to db_multirow, which causes it to put
	  the returned array in the calling proc's local store rather than
	  at the adp parse level.

	  This is useful when writing portlets which explicitly parse their
	  template file.

	* packages/acs-service-contract/sql/:

2001-12-28 18:13  donb

	* packages/acs-kernel/sql/postgresql/groups-body-create.sql:

	  acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.tcl, acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.xql:
	  Fixed the 4K character limit on session properties for Oracle by
	  making an optional "clob" value available.  The APM wouldn't let
	  me load any packages when I added all the dotLRN packages plus
	  standard packages over to a new "dotlrn" user from my normal
	  "acs" user - the list of packages grew to
	  > 4KB in size!  Grrrr!

	  the values ...

2001-12-22 10:58  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs-postgresql.tcl:

	  acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs-postgresql.xql,
	  acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.tcl, acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.xql:
	  Renamed a column named "timestamp" in the security package
	  because this is now a reserved word in PG (correctly).  I changed
	  the Oracle version, too, because I know that 9i has added the
	  "timestamp" datatype and even if it will accept it as a column
	  name it's confusing.

	  I also changes postgresql.sql to load correctly under PG 7.1 and
	  7.2.

	  changes in postgresql.sql (which now checks at varies its
	  behavior according to the version being run).

2001-12-13 09:25  donb

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/tag-procs.tcl:
	  Oops - I mindlessly copied a patch posted by Stephen Deasy to one

	  2. Fixed a bad port of an Oracle query in site-nodes-procs.tcl
	  and removed	 a needless outer join from both versions in the
	  process.

	* packages/: acs-admin/www/apm/index-oracle.xql,
	  acs-admin/www/apm/index-postgresql.xql,
	  acs-content-repository/sql/oracle/content-item.sql,
	  acs-content-repository/sql/postgresql/content-item.sql:
	  After importing openacs.org users, forums and messages I
	  discovered that it took literally several minutes to load the
	  APM's home page.  This was due to a rather stupid subselect of
	  the form:

	  select count(*) from content_revisions r where r.revision_id =
	  content_item.get_latest_revision(item_id)

	  where item_id comes from the package versions table.

	  It's stupid in both PG and Oracle because get_latest_revision
	  already joins the latest_revision_id value from cr_items with the
	  content revisions table thus a simple check for a null return by
	  get_latest_revision would be sufficient.

	  It's *really* stupid in Oracle because Oracle won't use the index
	  on revision_id when checking NULLs so we get two sequential scans
	  of the cr_revisions table tucked into that one itty-bitty
	  subquery (itself called once for each package version in ths
	  system).

	  Which explains why I hadn't noticed it while working on
	  scalability testing in PG - PG uses the index because its btree
	  index structure handles NULLs.  Meaning this query only fell
	  apart at a rate of O(log2(R)) rather than O(R) as in Oracle (R
	  being the number of revision objects in the system).

	  My solution was to rewrite the subselect using "case" rather than
	  "count(*)" and also to speed up get_latest_revision by having it
	  check for NULL and return NULL immediately rather than execute
	  the query (in PG this is accomplished by declaring the function
	  "isstrict", and the executor won't even call the function if the
	  argument's NULL, making it REALLY fast!).

	  || %)" never uses the index as we thought it did, as it turns out
	  ... see postgresql.sql for example queries that do.

	  AOLserver parameters are    case-insensitive.

	  2. A recently submitted patch to the db routine that PSQL's

	  3. Bboard was very, very slow in PG.	It is now much faster.

	  string in the database,     not exactly what you want.  I changed
	  the code to leave the input box     blank.

	  2.  caching of empty parameter strings didn't work.  I'd fixed
	  this earlier	   for ad_parameter proper but missed the fact that
	  ad_parameter_cache had     the same bug.

	  With these changes you can now run acs-workflow's admin UI

	  the "Notice" calls to    "Debug".  Then my one "Error" call I
	  added worked! :)  If a query file    has a syntax error in it
	  now, an error is logged to the server log but    bootstrapping
	  continues.

	  2. Lots and lots or etp oracle fixes and some PG version
	  clean-ups

	  3. Some file-storage files were unconventionally named.

	  permission to view regardless of whether it is live or not.

2001-09-10 13:38  donb

	  Mounted acs-workflow by default.  It is confusing not to do so
	  because it is listed as a core package that "probably isn't meant
	  to be mounted" by site map, and yet it is designed to be mounted.
	   I think that all core packages designed to be mounted should be
	  mounted at install time but haven't gone through to make sure
	  we're consistent.

	  acs-workflow has to be part of the core because the CR needs it.

	  1. Fixed a bug in the oracle version of acs-mail-nt-create.sql

	  2. Fixed a bug in the oracle version of the APM - a standard
	  SQL92    left join was being executed rather than the nasty
	  Oracle-specific    notation.

	  3. Futzed with the APM a bit - you can now only set "watch"
	  commands on	 those .xql files which are used by the current
	  installation, you can    only install packages supported by the
	  current installation's RDBMS.

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/: 30-xml-utils-procs.tcl, apm-xml-procs.tcl:

	  first attempt at doing XML parsing using ns_xml instead of the
	  Tcl XML stuff. Not sure yet if this is faster, although we expect
	  that it will be. Note also that there seems to be a bug right now
	  in ns_xml where an XML comment will screw things up, so I've
	  added a quick prepare function that takes out comments before XML
	  parsing... I'm not happy about that.

	  1. Fixed a couple of .info files 2. Got rid of Ben's hack to
	  always reload query files before doing a query    mapping.  He
	  did this so you wouldn't have to reboot AOLserver every    time
	  you change query files.  It was a short-term hack but
	  unfortunately    it looped virgin installs.  3. Added code to the
	  APM to make the "watch" feature work with query files    as well
	  as library files.   This makes Ben's hack mentioned above
	  unnecessary.

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/00-database-procs-postgresql.tcl:
	  Call to psql to load datamodels needs to be done in the directory
	  that the datamodel lives in, as includes in psql are resolved
	  relative to the current working directoy.  I missed this earlier
	  - sqlplus resolves includes relative to the loading .sql file
	  itself.

	  Moved the bootstrap and installer stuff into their own

	  and isolate all the bits of APM-knowledge required in the
	  pre-acs-tcl bootstrapping process into a single apm file.  In
	  general, bootstrap.tcl is cleaner and easier to read.
